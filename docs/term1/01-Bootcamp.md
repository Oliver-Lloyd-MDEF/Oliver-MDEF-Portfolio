# Bootcamp - Landing Week

Published: October 3, 2023

**03/10/23 - First day and intro lecture:** 

- introduced to all the faculty of the course and how they would be supporting us
- Shown what we are going to be focusing on this semester and just how much work there is going to be - it’s going to be tough, felt for a moment overwhelmed and worried that I had bitten more than I can chew
- Reminded that we are not designing alone, we are surrounded by our peers who want to help and we can help each other
- Met third director of the the programme - Laura, PhD in Philosophy and the person in charge of getting us to question ourselves, our whys and what we are as designers and creative people, much of this went right over my head if honest, but excited to learn more.
- Performed an exercise where we brought an item that meant something to us and placed it in the context of epistomatic knowledge theories, very difficult to understand but I think it was designed to get everyone to open up and share a little bit of vulnerability with each other. I showed my backpack, which symbolises to me a home anywhere in the world and the key to adventure and knowledge, as well as reminding me of Laia all the time as she is the one who gave it to me.
- Mostly spent lecture trying to visualise the work needed to be done over the course of the semester and trying to already figure out how I was going to plan my interventions - this was a bad idea, it got me focused on all the wrong things and not present in the moment.
- All the faculty seem really supportive and excited to help us grow as creatives and grow as creatives themselves through applying and facilitating the course. It seems like a constantly changing and developing masters which makes it really exciting.
- It seems like we really are on the cutting edge of design education here and pushing the boundaries of what’s possible as much as possible!
- Faculty seem very keen on seeing us as equals and not students, and have even organised informal drinks for everyone to get to know each other.
- Excited to see the rest of the week and what it has in store, and curious to see what the first assignment will be - apparently building a personal blog website?

**04/10/23 - Faculty Research areas and Poblenou Tour**

- started the day with two different lectures from two of the course directors, Guillem & Tomas, where they told us about what projects they’ve worked on, how they’ve developed them and what their areas of research focus are now.
    - this was super interesting, because the projects were so varied and seemed to really be having an impact! Ranging from areas around sustainable hydrogen production in Bali to provide clean energy to fisherman, to noise reduction smart citizen kits using open source technologies that are still produced and sold today. Mentioned a lot of inspiring things that made me think I was definitely in the right place.
    - The Fablab and Fabcity projects really seem to be pushing the boundaries of what’s possible right now with rapid prototyping. It really seemed to be pushing towards design for the other 90% not just what we do a lot right now in the western world which is design for that one 10% that can afford well designed products and services.
- Following that lecture, a tour of Poblenou:
    - Chiara (one of our faculty and the rock of the programme) took us on a tour around the area we are going to be living and met some of the supporting projects and foundations that exist in the neighbourhood.
    - What follows is a list and description of the different people and enterprises we met:
        - Biciclot
        - Bioma
        - Transfolabs
        - Gallery

**05/10/2023 - Documenting Design intro, building with Gitlab and Classroom rearranging with mini fablab**

- Day started with a morning class in documenting design (or the importance of it, it’s benefits and how it will help throughout the course, our careers and our lives) taught by Pablo Zuolaga, former MDEF alumni from a few years ago. Pablo used to work as a creative lead for a marketing agency in Colombia, creating advertising campaigns for global brands around the world.
- taught us the importance of keeping a great log of everything we do throughout our various projects and creative work. Showing us examples from his own personal life where documenting this process and publishing is what opened new doors and opportunities that he had never even dreamed about or thought possible before!
- reminded us about how it can act as a great reminder and also a catalyst for creativity as you can look back on your old work, see and track your old thought processes, pick up where you left off from or notice was of thinking and doing that have now changed as you have gained new knowledge and ways of doing that maybe now mean that you are able to start up a project once again when before you had hit a roadblock and didn’t know how to get any further.
- he stressed the importance of using pictures and videos to aid in this documentation, and gave a really great breakdown of how to tell a great story through your project documentation that makes it both interesting and engaging to read and follow along with! (hence all the pictures and videos, they do say 1000 words after all)
- showed us how this type of documentation was going to be assessed by him and other faculty to see how we were keeping on top of our work and our project research, which is a great way of engaging with all the student work when they can.
- Every week we are encoruaged to keep a log of everything that has happened on that day and turn that into a relfection or blog post or what ever you like, as a way to document everything and keep track of your thoughts, feelings and processes about the work that we are doing.
    - funnily enough, alot of the things Pablo mentioned, i’d already learned studying my Bachelors in Product Design at Bounremouth University, particularly when it focused on the importance of documenting everything in reference to a portfolio of work, which I felt really happy about as I thought that I could definitely keep on top of this through what I already know.
    - What excited me even more though, was knowing that now I’m going to learn how to really tell a good story through all this documenting, something I was never really good at before, my previous portfolios and dsign documentation have always felt really linear, following the next logical step i.e Ideation, Development, Concept selection, Testing, Refining, Detail design then implemention. Never really including any sort of problem, troubles, triumphs and failures along the way, I’ve recently started to try and do this on my own to my exisitng portfolio website and to rewrite, reframe and structure it to turn it into a narrative. So having someone like Pablo (with all his knowledge in creative story telling for advertising) there to reexamine, review and bounce ideas off to further develop this side of documentation makes me really happy and I think I’m going to learn a lot from this.  Excited to see where this goes and how I can develop my writing further from this.
    - In an effort to improve, i’m going to try and keep my reflections brief but engaging, detgailing everything weve done and the research I am working on week by week in a blog post format that I want to start to share on other social media platforms and not just the website we are building so that it keeps me accoutnable but also hopefully engages a wider audience who might be interested in the work we do here on this masters!
- Following Pablo’s lesson we had a course from Josep Marti (our resident expert on all things coding and digital building) on how to create, set up and develop our own personal portfolio website using Github and Gitbash.
- this was super interesting and the idea of learning how to write it all and code it using python scripts through Git is a really cool thing that I want to get much better at over the coming weeks. Though I admit that I fell behind in this class quite quickly as I was still figuring out all the set up for it.
- this is an area I definitely still need to improve on, as coding is something I never really learned before and for ages never had any interest in doing so. Though now, it’s been put in a different perspective and I can see how it can actually be used to create products and services that I would use every day, and being able to do it myself gives me a real sense of ownership over the work which is great!
- There is still far more to learn that I don’t know but with the help from my amazing classmates and Josep I think we’ll get there!
- It’s a fantastic way of learning by doing ,instead of having to watch countless hours of video or lectures on the principles behind coding and then doing it later you do it right there in class and outside of it with a real goal in mind; to develop the website that is going to host pretty much all of the documentation of the work we are going to be doing this year (and coincidentally where all our work will be marked by the faculty — so it **has** to work) in one place. Making sure that we really learn it as fast as possible and create something that really works out in the real world instead of just small practice problems and solutions that never get used again after that. Brilliant stuff.
- After that, we spent some time rearranging the classroom into an orientation that made it more comfortable to work in and developed it into a space that we could really grow into and use to suit our needs for the year.
- We used the fablab on theg round floor of the IAAC building to create furniture and workbenches that we were going to need to prototype various things in our classroom —basically turning it into a mini fablab of it’s own!
- everyone worked together to achieve a common goal and it was a really great way to see how we were all going to work and interact with eachother which I really enjoyed!

**06/10/23 - Exploring Elisava Design School Campus and Faculty member Laura’s Research background**

- in the morning we toured around the Elisava campus (the other university we are part of and whose facilities we have access too — very cool stuff) received our welcome packs and intro lectures to how we can access and use the facilites and toured what they had on offer.
    - it’s a lot of high tech stuff but also a lot more rules than at the Fablab — there are more people they need to take care of so it makes sense.
- we had a lecture from Laura Benitez (the third director of our programme and a doctor in philosophy) on her research background and what areas she is focusing on now.
- A lot of really cool topics from Biohacking, to trans and post humanism, transfeminism and many more that went completely over my head. I think I’m going to really enjoy what she has to teach us but it’ll definitely take me some time to get to understand it all and really grasp the depth of her research and knowledge.
    - seems like her lectures will be focused on asking ourselves who and what we are, what is our fight/purpose/why, why we create the way we do and how does that develop who we are as we create for these emerging futures.
    - A lot of introspection here I think, in the next few months of the course.
