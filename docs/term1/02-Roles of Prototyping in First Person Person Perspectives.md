# Roles of Prototyping in First Person Person Perspective (1PP) Research through Design

Created: October 9, 2023 10:23 AM


## 1PP Interventions

### Ways of knowledge in 1PP (1PP RtD)

- Experiential
- Crafting
    - by being part of the system and taking a physical part in the prototyping of an intervention allows a more in depth perspective
- Augmenting
- Socio-Political

### What do we know about 1PP?

- it is a way of acting (David Kirsch)
- It is a way of looking at things (Ezio)
- it is a way of being involved (Laura Forlano)

### Challenges of 1PP:

- Working with materials at hand (Nithikhul Nimkulrat)
- Putting yourself at risk (Kia Hook)
- Committing to 1PP in practice (Marcel van Heist, Jop Japenga)
- 

### Scales of 1PP:

- being with the material flow
- community intra-relations
- Socio-technical and environmental infrastructures
- Putting yourself at risk (Kia Hook)
- Committing to 1PP in practice (Marcel van Heist, Jop Japenga)

## Roles of Prototyping

> **Prototypes are experiments designed to test specific hypotheses that are physically embedded in the artefact.**
> 

Examples include: 

- usability tests of the prototypes
- experiential trials to assess the design attributes such as aesthetics
- cases where the prototype is treated as a physical hypothesis.

### Role 1: The prototype as an experimental component

Prototypes are experiments designed to test specific hypotheses that are physically embedded in the artefact.

Examples are: usability tests of the prototypes, experiential trials to assess the design attributes such as aesthetics, or cases where the prototype is treated as a physical hypothesis.

### Role 2: The prototype as a means of inquiry

> Prototypes have been developed and deployed as **instruments of inquiry,** in much the way that scientists use specifically designed instruments to **collect, record and measure** phenomena
> 
- used in the past as a method to encourage reflection on how designers need to be part of the entire lifecycle of the product, and not just ship it off to market and wash their hands of it.
- can be any form of inquiry, from a survey to a cardboard model etc
- prototyping can be done when one still doesn’t know what they want to create, as it is a means to finding out knowledge and understanding about the field of research.

### Role 3: The prototype as a research archetype

Research archetypes are physical embodiments of concepts, understandings or design spaces.

These prototypes are principally exemplary and illustrative, even (and especially) when they are exposing confrontational or contradictory scenarios.

### Role 4: The process of prototyping as a vehicle for inquiry

> The process of making a prototype is instrumental in doing design research.
In this role, the process becomes a means of inquiry, akin to a research method.
The process is documented, analysed, critically assessed and written up, and the research contribution is tied not to the artefact itself as much as to how the artefact was crafted.

***Reflection & Understanding:*** *As a designer in this program, or any design program/work actually it is important to remember that you aren’t married to just one of these prototyping roles for each step of the design journey. You can use any one of them at any time to achieve the desired output, often times combing various roles to achieve what you set out to find out.* 

*These forms of prototyping are very similar to what I learned during my bachelors degree, using prototyping as a form of experimentation and play to figure out just exactly what might be the right direction to go in, creating rough models from cardstock and cardboard to alpha test usability, user interaction, sizing and place finding that can then lead you in the right direction.*

### Activity 1 - Understanding prototyping roles and how we’ve applied them in past work

Discussing past projects and how we applied the various prototyping roles into those projects in a group activity, reflecting with others on whether or not those really were the correct prototyping roles we identified. 

**Reflection & Understanding:** 

- *important to break down the larger idea behind the project into it’s smaller more focused components, this where you can identify the different prototyping roles and how they fit into the design process*
- *collaborating and discussing with others in the group to get their perspectives was really helpful and interesting, it created a much more open dialogue about past work and how to re-evaluate it for a deeper understanding*
- *really enjoyed seeing everyone else’s perspectives on how they might have applied the different  prototyping roles based on their different backgrounds.*

### Activity 2 - Discussing and re-defining past project work with others through collaboration

In our groups, we each described a past piece of work from our creative or professional backgrounds and what prototyping role we used within that project. Then we each picked a project from another in the group and attempted to reframe that project through the use of the other prototyping roles that could be applied to that project that were not applied the first time round. While roughly prototyping a small mock-up of our changes through rough sketching and low tech prototyping materials like paper, cardboard, popsicle sticks, tape and plenty of metaphors.

From within my group I picked Albert’s project (Albert is an environmental conservationist by training and vocation), his past project was a small low cost camera trap for small mammalian carnivores to allow environmental scientists to gather data on these animals and their population. 

The project  clearly used roles 1 & 2 of prototyping in its creation and implementation, and I tried to reframe this project using Role 4, by creating a connected rough mock-up for a connected database for these traps that would allow the data to be collected, analysed and categorised in near real time by not just scientists but also normal citizens interested in taking part in citizen science. Both as a way to create a prototype that streamlined the data collection process and sped it up, but also as a way to encourage to the general populace to start asking more questions about the nature around them and realising it’s importance. 

**Reflection:**

- *this was a really interesting exercise which I struggled with in the beginning, I struggled with understanding the difference between the different roles of prototyping and how you could reframe a project through them as I have only ever known prototyping as an umbrella term for doing whatever testing or making you needed to do to collect data that will prove your idea will work, so applying this framework to my own work, let alone someone else’s work was quite a thing to wrap my head around in the beginning.*
- *The exercise made me think of how I developed my past projects in completely new ways, it sort of made me unlearn a little what I thought I already knew about how to prototype and also created a new understanding of how I can look at future projects, a new lens in which to see how to best identify the most useful prototyping role or roles that could serve the best purpose for generating data that can be usefully applied to further the creative process. Which is something I really liked!*
