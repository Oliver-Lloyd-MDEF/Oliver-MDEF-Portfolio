# Atlas of Weak Signals

# What is a weak signal?

- It’s an early indicator of change
- A tame indicator that has the potential to become a large game changer in the immediate future
- A point of inflection of change
- An **Atlas of Weak Signals (AoWS)** is a tool for designing for **emergent futures**
- In order to design for emergent futures it is **fundamental to sit with oneself**
- can be done through creating a **design space**

---

## Design Space:

- used to define collections of ideas and concepts
- A mirror, a tool to define reflection as bringing unconscious experience to awareness, to question values, attitudes and perspectives we unconsciously embody as designers and creatives
- A fluid and dynamic space
    - it is always changing, with new ideas coming in to complement existing ones or replace old and outdated ones
    - that is kept up to date
    - recalibration of practice

## Key roles of a design space:

- situating
    - **understanding** **surroundings**
    - allowing **links** between different elements and ideas, as well as other collaborative interventions to arise
- Organisational
    - **reducing complexity**
    - making sense
    - seeing what **connections** arise between various elements and signals
- Narrative
    - Allows you to **take a step back and understand your own narrative** better through the diverse collection of ideas
    - Allows new conversations, ideas and collaborations to arise
- Performative or Participative
    - combining design spaces - “collaborative design spaces”
    - Performative as giving feedback to oneself
        - encourages reflection through the creation of these spaces more than once
- Inspirational
    - Bring together projects, state of the art, and influences that might create new connections and ideas

# Understanding the Atlas of Weak Signals and Design Spaces through making our own and identifying new signals

My main area of interest lies in the concept of solarpunk, focusing on the combination of local production and global connections. I have identified two key weak signals to build upon: long-termism and human-machine creative collaborations. These signals emphasize the importance of considering the impact of our actions on future generations and leveraging the collaborative power of humans and machines. Within this framework, I am concentrating on three key areas of opportunity: digital fabrication, circular economy, and material development. These areas, when harnessed effectively, have the potential to pave the way for a solarpunk future.

By fostering cooperation between humans and machines, we can unlock innovative solutions in biomaterials, circular economies, and doughnut economic models. This collaboration ensures that the goals of long-termism are maintained, with a focus on creating products and policies that account for the well-being of future generations. Through localized digital fabrication hubs, we can harness the unique capabilities of both humans and machines, pushing the boundaries of innovation. This approach not only aligns with the solarpunk ethos but also contributes to the vision of a sustainable future framed by localized production, global connectivity, and a deep commitment to the well-being of all generations to come.

# New signals

### 1. Climate Change Adaptation

Climate change-related events, such as extreme weather conditions and natural disasters, pose significant risks to supply chains. Strategies for adapting to these challenges are becoming crucial weak signal areas.

### 2. Water Conservation

Emerging technologies for water conservation, such as advanced filtration systems and smart irrigation techniques, signal a growing focus on preserving water resources, especially in water-scarce regions.
