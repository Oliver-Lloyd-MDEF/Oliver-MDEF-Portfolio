Throughout this module, we are focusing on techniques and methodologies to effectively communicate our ideas to people from all kinds of backgrounds, from technical to business to policymakers. 

Led by Pablo, it‚Äôs going to be a comprehensive training on how to get our ideas across in the most effective and engaging ways so that our projects and ideas can stand on a strong foundation when put out into the world and hopefully gain the attention they need to start making a real impact in society.

## The Golden Circle

At the outset of any project, it‚Äôs important to try and map out our motivations for undertaking the project, this is a reflective exercise and it‚Äôs a really useful tool for mapping out your deeper motivations and a useful reminder as your projects naturally unwind and meander towards the final goal. 

**How does it work?** 

In a series of concentric circles, map out Why, How, What. Start to populate each circle with words you associate with your project and the directions you want it to go in (*you don‚Äôt have to do this exactly like I‚Äôm describing it, but I find it a useful way to just get some ideas down on paper to start with).* 

Once you‚Äôve done this, try to extract from each circle an answer to these questions, try to keep it concise, like you are answering with a tweet (~250 characters).

When you are done it should look something like this: 

### ***My Golden Circle:***

<figcaption>This an illustration of how I structured my golden circle, using words loosely associated with each ring helps get ideas down on paper</figcaption>

### ***My Key Guiding Questions:***

**Why do I want to do it?**
I want to use design to explore developing tools across hardware, service and policy design that aims to help transition us into a more solarpunk and regenerative future by exploring big data and transition design thinking.

**How do I want to do it?**
Through a combination of first-person perspective design, collaborative participation, open source technologies, human-machine collaborations and circular design principles.

**What do I want to do?**
Create tools and services that help us redefine our relationship with energy, shifting our energy consumption habits through easy-to-use energy monitoring hardware that uses a combination of AIoT and easy-to-repair hardware.

## Stakeholder Mapping

Stakeholder mapping is a really useful tool to help you visualise the people, places, services and things you have around you that can access to promote your project or idea. The way it works is to place your project in the centre of a series of rings, expanding outwards from the centre you place 3 more rings, each representing a sphere of influence, the closest to your project (*or yourself, depending on how you frame it*) is the one in your immediate grasp that you could access today, and each ring after not directly connected to you and might require more work to access. 

*e.g. A person in the closest ring might be a friend, family member, direct co-worker etc. and the second ring might be an acquaintance, an old boss, while the third ring is someone you don‚Äôt know but would like to work with or ask for funding etc that will require more work on your end before you can reach out to them.*

### My Project Research Map (*so far‚Ä¶)*

<figcaption>The curernt state of my stakeholder map at the start of my project research</figcaption>

Right now my main area of research interest is energy. Our relationship to it, how we consume it and the environmental impact this consumption has. I‚Äôm not sure what the project will end up being so right now all the stakeholders I‚Äôm focused on are those who I think might have the ability to foster interesting discussions and direction for the research to progress. Further on down the line as the project develops and hopefully turns into something more concrete, this map also maps some early knowledge I have on potential businesses and investors I might be able to work with to bring the project further or expand its area of influence. 

At this stage, much of the research is focused on first-person perspective work around energy habits I experience, as well as building out potentials for prototypes with the faculty at FabLab BCN. As the project gains more insight and I can start to develop a concrete idea, I hope I can reach out to different groups already working in AI and energy consumption to consult with them and gain some experience that can help push the project towards a tangible solution.

For me this is an incredibly useful tool for creating an everchanging visual map of what I have at my disposal that takes the research and projects I undertake to new levels and directions that I might not have thought of.

## Communicating Design Tandem Project

As a big part of this module, we have to learn about and understand the project of a classmate, learning about and evaluating each other‚Äôs projects as they develop, and be there as someone to bounce ideas off when you are stuck.  

To achieve this, my classmate Marius and I have decided to film a series of conversations we are going to have as our projects develop, where we update each other on the progress of the research, we ask questions, poke holes and provide an outside perspective on the work to help each other out. It also helps that we both think it‚Äôs a really fun way to document and log the entire journey from start to finish. 

**You can find the first episode linked below ‚Äî as we progress through the year, more and more episodes will be linked here** üòÉ.

## Project Communication Deck

### What is the project so far?

The project has evolved from where it was since it‚Äôs inception, what originally started as an interest in the broad topic of our relationship with energy in all it‚Äôs forms based on early research into the ideals of the 2000 watt society, it‚Äôs narrowed down for now into developing an of energy monitor prototype that can be paired with an AI bot we‚Äôve developed that we affectionately call ‚Äú*Dan*‚Äù. 

The idea was to experiment with creating products and systems that can be easily accessed and understood in an open source way, that could help remove some of the mental strain and bandwidth uptake when you try to understand and calculate every single bit of energy you use. 

We thought that if we could make it easier to interact with and understand your energy consumption in your own house, through a conversational and collaborative approach, it might make tackling the issue of your own energy consumption easier to manage. 

Using a telegram text message interface, you are able to interface and chat with Dan, this familiar interface makes it easier to approach this topic (we think) as it allows you to ask as many questions you want to a system that slowly learns about everything that uses energy in your home, and as it learns you will learn as well. 

Increasing your own awareness through conversation with an ever present and ever patient system that isn‚Äôt punitive or commanding about how you should use your energy but knowledgeable and eager to help you reduce your own consumption in any way that it can. This paired with a simple physical hardware system that connects directly to your mains power line, should give you a comprensive overview of your entire energy usage.

### Project Vision, Mission and Purpose

The project‚Äôs mission can be defined by the following statement:

**‚ÄúHow can we create a system that empowers/enables people to reduce their energy consumption footprint without reducing their quality of life?‚Äù**

We want to use this research to explore how design can exist as a transitional tool, helping to faciliate the transition from the old dominant system of overconsumption of fossil fuel energies towards the new and emerging system of renewable energies by helping people to live and enjoy the same quality of life they‚Äôve always been enjoying while doing more with less fossil fuel based energy, and hopefully encouraging the transitions we need to renewable energy systems.

### Project Personality 

The project uses the following archetype personalities to define itself: 

**Sage, Caregiver, Magician, Creator**

<img src="../images/15. Communicating Design 02/5.jpg" alt="Project Archetypes" style="border-radius: 5px;">

Each of these archetypes lends something different to the project, working as guiding principles for how we want to present the research and prototypes we‚Äôve developed. 

<img src="../images/15. Communicating Design 02/6.jpg" alt="Tone of Voice" style="border-radius: 5px;">

For this project the tone of voice is equally important, as it encapsulates just how we want people to perceive our project through the prototypes we‚Äôve developed, we want people to feel comfortable using both the energy monitor and Dan the energy bot. 

### The stakeholder's radar

<img src="../images/15. Communicating Design 02/7.jpg" alt="Stakeholder Map" style="border-radius: 5px;">

The stakeholders radar hasn‚Äôt changed much from the previous time I updated it, it now contains a few more refined sources for communities we can reach out to for further research as well different departments we can approach within goverment and policy making to understand the perceptions within governemnt to technologies such as these. 

### Communication Matrix

<img src="../images/15. Communicating Design 02/8.jpg" alt="Communication Matrix" style="border-radius: 5px;">

The communication matrix is a very useful table, it helps us to map exactly how we are going to approach different stakeholders from our map mentioned above, from what media platform is best to approach them on, if they require pitch decks or pre written articles, what we want them to feel when we approach them as well as what we want them to think. 

This tool has been especially helpful, being able to plan ahead for how we can approach different media and stakeholders has been fantastic for reducing the friction and stress about reaching out to these stakeholders to present our work. 

If you can lay it all out ahead for you, you can plan exactly for what‚Äôs ahead of you. Using this tool among many of the others we learnt about during the communicating design module, we are staring to get a really good base footing for bringing our ideas out into the real world.
