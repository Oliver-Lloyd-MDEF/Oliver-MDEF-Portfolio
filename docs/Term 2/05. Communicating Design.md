Throughout this module, we are focusing on techniques and methodologies to effectively communicate our ideas to people from all kinds of backgrounds, from technical to business to policymakers. 

Led by Pablo, itâ€™s going to be a comprehensive training on how to get our ideas across in the most effective and engaging ways so that our projects and ideas can stand on a strong foundation when put out into the world and hopefully gain the attention they need to start making a real impact in society.

## The Golden Circle

At the outset of any project, itâ€™s important to try and map out our motivations for undertaking the project, this is a reflective exercise and itâ€™s a really useful tool for mapping out your deeper motivations and a useful reminder as your projects naturally unwind and meander towards the final goal. 

**How does it work?** 

In a series of concentric circles, map out Why, How, What. Start to populate each circle with words you associate with your project and the directions you want it to go in (*you donâ€™t have to do this exactly like Iâ€™m describing it, but I find it a useful way to just get some ideas down on paper to start with).* 

Once youâ€™ve done this, try to extract from each circle an answer to these questions, try to keep it concise, like you are answering with a tweet (~250 characters).

When you are done it should look something like this:

### ***My Key Guiding Questions:***

**Why do I want to do it?**
I want to use design to explore developing tools across hardware, service and policy design that aims to help transition us into a more solarpunk and regenerative future by exploring big data and transition design thinking.

**How do I want to do it?**
Through a combination of first-person perspective design, collaborative participation, open source technologies, human-machine collaborations and circular design principles.

**What do I want to do?**
Create tools and services that help us redefine our relationship with energy, shifting our energy consumption habits through easy-to-use energy monitoring hardware that uses a combination of AIoT and easy-to-repair hardware.

## Stakeholder Mapping

Stakeholder mapping is a really useful tool to help you visualise the people, places, services and things you have around you that can access to promote your project or idea. The way it works is to place your project in the centre of a series of rings, expanding outwards from the centre you place 3 more rings, each representing a sphere of influence, the closest to your project (*or yourself, depending on how you frame it*) is the one in your immediate grasp that you could access today, and each ring after not directly connected to you and might require more work to access. 

*e.g. A person in the closest ring might be a friend, family member, direct co-worker etc. and the second ring might be an acquaintance, an old boss, while the third ring is someone you donâ€™t know but would like to work with or ask for funding etc that will require more work on your end before you can reach out to them.*

### My Project Research Map (*so farâ€¦)*

<figcaption>The curernt state of my stakeholder map at the start of my project research</figcaption>

Right now my main area of research interest is energy. Our relationship to it, how we consume it and the environmental impact this consumption has. Iâ€™m not sure what the project will end up being so right now all the stakeholders Iâ€™m focused on are those who I think might have the ability to foster interesting discussions and direction for the research to progress. Further on down the line as the project develops and hopefully turns into something more concrete, this map also maps some early knowledge I have on potential businesses and investors I might be able to work with to bring the project further or expand its area of influence. 

At this stage, much of the research is focused on first-person perspective work around energy habits I experience, as well as building out potentials for prototypes with the faculty at FabLab BCN. As the project gains more insight and I can start to develop a concrete idea, I hope I can reach out to different groups already working in AI and energy consumption to consult with them and gain some experience that can help push the project towards a tangible solution.

For me this is an incredibly useful tool for creating an everchanging visual map of what I have at my disposal that takes the research and projects I undertake to new levels and directions that I might not have thought of.

## Communicating Design Tandem Project

As a big part of this module, we have to learn about and understand the project of a classmate, learning about and evaluating each otherâ€™s projects as they develop, and be there as someone to bounce ideas off when you are stuck.  

To achieve this, my classmate Marius and I have decided to film a series of conversations we are going to have as our projects develop, where we update each other on the progress of the research, we ask questions, poke holes and provide an outside perspective on the work to help each other out. It also helps that we both think itâ€™s a really fun way to document and log the entire journey from start to finish. 

**You can find the first episode linked below â€” as we progress through the year, more and more episodes will be linked here** ðŸ˜ƒ.
