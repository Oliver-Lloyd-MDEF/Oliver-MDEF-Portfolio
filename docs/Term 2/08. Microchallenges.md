## Microchallenge 1 ~ Sensing the World

 This was our first week long micro challenge, an intense week where we combine all the knowledge we‚Äôve been exposed to and practical skills we‚Äôve been learning to create prototypes that can further serve to help us in the explorations of our various interventions. 

For this challenge, my classmate Carlotta and I paired up together to explore how we could create different artefacts that could help with understanding energy management, consumption and eventually reduction which fit nicely into our overarching thesis research area, and we counted it towards our second intervention in this space.  

### What did we do?

We had decided to see if we could build a more open and intuitive way for energy consumption management. We wanted to explore how we could better create tools to visualise how much energy we were consuming at home with the aim of trying to reduce some of the brain bandwidth strain when thinking about just how much energy we use in a day. 

All of the information, code, images and schematics we developed can be found in our GitHub repository linked blow! üëá

### Finding common ground

As Carlotta and I already knew we shared the same interests, but not necessarily the exact same goals for the research, we plotted out all the things we wanted to explore over the course of the week to see if we could find overlap that would allow us to create something that we were both really interested in. Using a Miro board and a Venn diagram, we laid everything that had thought of that might want to explore.

We knew we already shared a lot of the same interests when it came to this topic, so there was a steady amount of overlap. We both wanted to explore how we could combine energy consumption with AIoT (Artificial Intelligence of Things) to create easier and more intuitive forms of energy management. 

Then we sketched out a few ideas, thoughts on prototypes and made a plan for the rest of the week so that we could hit the ground running.

### Learning by doing‚Ä¶

In our original plan for this week, we‚Äôd planned to make two things really, an open source way to display energy consumption from an energy monitor and (*ideally*) our own little open source energy monitor. We thought that we‚Äôd be able to get the software part done quickly as there were plenty of projects we could work off of to get the ball rolling (*and we had that same exact thought for the monitor we wanted to build as well*).

The software we developed took us much longer than we‚Äôd initially anticipated, and at this point we‚Äôd decided that we wanted to make sure that we could have the software working properly before we started working on anything else, we spent the entire week acting as rudimentary software developers. 

*For a pair of product designers previously trained almost exclusively on developing hardware this was certainly a challenge.* 

We most definitely learnt by doing throughout this entire week, and we put together a little video that encapsulates a lot of what we got up to during this development week which you can see below.

But it was all worth it. 

### Final Result ~ Open Energy Monitoring and a Conversational Consumption bot

What we finally ended up developing over the course of the week was a little multi-faceted. We decided to use some of the Tapo smart plugs we‚Äôd bought and had been using for a previous intervention as our energy monitor of choice to speed up development time. 

This turned out to be a great idea, as it turns out that someone else had wanted to do the same idea as us and read the data the plug was generating without needing the accompanying app. They had managed to develop a basic python script that would install and use a specific library unique to these Tapo Plugs, allowing you to read any information from them as well as control them as well. 

<aside>
üí° *A python library is a modular component of code that can be imported into your python script from the main python library where all these different components are stored*

</aside>

From this starting point we were able to develop the script even further to give us exactly what data we wanted from the plug i.e. Current Usage in Watts, Total Consumption, Monthly Consumption etc‚Ä¶ we were then able to display this image through a a script Carlotta wrote in P5.js that would visualise that live consumption data in a way that was slightly more visually appealing. Finally we decided that it would be really interesting if you could ‚Äúask‚Äù your house for how much energy you were using through a text message.

With this simple idea, Dan the Energy Bot was born.

**Dan the Energy Bot**

We wanted to explore how we could create a more collaborative and conversational method of learning about your energy consumption and how to reduce it. We thought that if you were able to send a simple text message (*in this case Telegram, but hopefully more messenger services later*)  asking what your energy consumption was and it would respond with telling you your current usage. 

We built the entire system in an environment called Node-Red, which is an open source program dedicated to connecting different APIs and other information sources together. It allows you to build out any kind of automation system you want and is a favourite for open source electronics projects or home automation systems and for good reason. After a bit of a learning curve we were able to get the hang of it and built out or system for right now.

While it works, there are still a few flaws, Dan is very keen to provide you with your usage once you‚Äôve asked and we aren't quite sure how to turn him off once he‚Äôs started but that‚Äôs a problem for the next challenge: **Working with Extended Intelligence**

### Final Thoughts and Next Steps

This was a really intense week, but it was also incredibly rewarding. We learned far more about coding than we thought we would, and we developed something that we really hadn‚Äôt thought we would either. We learned the limits of what we could produce in such a short time as well as the limits of the existing technologies we were using. Once we‚Äôd crossed the hurdle of figuring out how to ‚Äúhack‚Äù the tech we had to do what we wanted to do it set us off an an exciting path as new ideas formed for what we could develop further to improve on these technologies.  

We definitely want to keep developing our consumption AI to develop it into a much more useful learning companion, as well as keep going with developing an energy monitor that could be developed from a kit you could put together at home.  

We now also want to explore if it¬¥s possible to combine all these technologies together to create one system that can monitor your whole home‚Äôs energy consumption without needing multiple ‚Äúsmart‚Äù plugs connected all over the home, and return useful information that allows you to make hyper personalised adjustments based on your needs. 

Like a self learning smart meter, just really chatty and inquisitive. Learning from you and with you as you figure out just how much energy your home is consuming

## Microchallenge 2 ~ Designing with Intelligences

### Conversational Energy Tracking & Open Source Hardware

This microchallenge followed on from our first one a few weeks back. Carlotta and I partnered up together once again to continue developing our open energy monitoring project and put more of our focus into building our chatbot into a functional and useful assistant and companion. Paired with this, we started to build our own energy monitoring hardware based off arduino to create an easily accessible prototype that could be paired to our energy AI. 

As before, we‚Äôve documented the whole process in much more detail, as well as including all the code files and prototype schematics in a GitHub Repository which you can view by clicking the link below!

### What was our goal?

After the first micro challenge we got talking about what  ways we could push this open source device further and how the chatbot aspect would work. 

The aim of this challenge was to use a form (*really any kind*) of intelligence to create a physical output. 

*i.e. turning sound waves into gcode usinng an AI that would move a robot, for example.* 

Knowing we wanted to keep developing our energy bot ‚ÄòDan‚Äô we knew had the first part figured out. However it was the second half of the challenge that was stumping us:

***We had no idea what kind of physical output we could create from Dan.***

We brainstormed and threw around a few ideas on what the physical output could be for challenge, which ranged from creating a daily report about how much energy you‚Äôve used on a given day, printing lists of energy saving tips, or highlight what was consomuning the most energy in your life. 

In the end we settled on raising awareness for the project and the issues we are working on.

### Making a plan

We created a plan for the week, evaluating our skills and divided our time equally between developing the AI Chatbot and building the energy monitor. We created this all in our shared miro board which allowed us to divide and conquer the tasks and challenges for the week.

<figcaption> Planning our week, helping us to divide and conquer the tasks we needed to do</figcaption>

### The logic of Information

To turn ‚ÄòDan‚Äô into a properly functioning energy assistant we had to take some time to understand just what exactly we were trying to build and how each of the components within the information flow would work. Combing through the documentation on Node-Red‚Äôs own site, stack overflow and Chat-GPT (for coding assitance if it became necessary, *which was most of the time*) to figure out how we could build out our Node-Red flow to support our needs even further. 

We were able to use a google sheets API node to connect to a spreadsheet database we‚Äôd made to log energy consumption data that our chatbot could access for context specific information. To make it possible to have an actual coherent conversation with ‚ÄòDan‚Äô we used a Chat GPT API node that allowed us to send information after a specifc prompt to the large language model, where it would process that information and respond with a short and (*hopefully*) accurate response about your energy consumption habits, this node was also able to read the contextual knoweldge from the spreadsheet database as well. 

***These nodes had already been created by others who had wanted to explore these tecnologies themselves, which was great as it gave us some legs to stand on at the start of this challenge.***

## The Outcome

### Dan the Energy Bot

Dan in it‚Äôs current form takes a variety of input queries coming in through Telegram from the us (the users) and tries to have a conversation with us. While doing this, it is also constantly logging consumption data from the energy monitoring hardware itself in the google sheets database we‚Äôve created for it.

This database gives ‚ÄòDan‚Äô much better context on what exactly is consuming energy in the home and allows it to give you much better advice on your consumption habits. 

Right now there are still a few bugs to work out but as of the time of this writing, it‚Äôs possible to have a fully contextually aware conversation with ‚ÄòDan‚Äô about all things energy related. 

**You can check out how we interact with ‚ÄòDan‚Äô in the video below!** üëá

To fulfill one of the tasks for this microchallenge, Dan will also provide you with a series of printable stickers based on the advice you recieve, which can be used both as a personal reminder to take part in better energy practices but also as a label for what appliances use more energy than others and if they might need changing or not. 

Right now we aren‚Äôt sure if this feature will stick around, but right now it‚Äôs a good bit of fun, and helps engage people in a friendlier and approachable way.

### Our Energy Monitor

<img src="../images/20. Microchallenges/Challenge 2/Energy Monitor Prototype 1.png" alt="energy monitor prototype" style="border-radius: 5px;">
<figcaption> This is our first energy monitor prototype, it even includes a small screen to track consumption data right on the device itself</figcaption>

At the current stage of our research and then end of this challenge we have a fully functioning energy monitor. Like we originally wanted, it‚Äôs based off of ardunio and other components we were able to source locally. 

While it works and is able to read the energy data coming through a extension lead we‚Äôve connected it to, there is a small issue with some of the readings it makes. Our voltage and current readings are slightly too high, disrupting and reducing the accuracy of the results. 

Thanks to one of professors, we quickly learned that most of our data was a bit off because we were trying to measure the current in 3 wires instead of just one, as the current transformers we were using were better suited to one than 3, once we‚Äôd corrected this problem our readings started to look a whole lot more accurate than before, but definitely still require some tweaking to get them fully dialed in. 

***This is already raising a lot of questions for me, for instance: if we want many people to use these devices are they each going to have to calibrate it themselves? and is that going to put people off from wanting to use it? I‚Äôm not sure yet.***

Hopefully with enough modifications our monitor will be able to clip into your breaker box and watch all the energy being consumed in your house without needing many different interconnected plugs in each socket. 

We‚Äôve now started work on a second version of the monitor that uses a different ardunio based board (*called the Barduino 4.0 developed by the excellent people here at Fablab)* which includes an esp-32 chip, this is important as it allows us to send consumption data dirrectly to our node red flow and into our AI. This lets us reduce the number of components we need to fully develop this project!

## Final Thoughts and Reflections on this week

This microchallenge has been a lot of fun, we've made significant progress in our research into measuring and understanding energy consumption, as well as how we can combine this information with big data technologies like AI in a collaborative and conversational way.

We made even more progress in understanding our skills in coding and basic programming using tools like Node-Red, coding with Javascript and Arduino as well as understanding how to adapt existing state of the art technologies through different API calls.

It was nice this time around do a bit of hardware development, even if it was just a basic circuit to understand the real world aspects of our research, which was a welcome change to just working on software as we did in the previous microchallenge.

We can definitely feel ourselves adapting as designers, turning into hybrid designers from pure product designers we were before, this an exciting area for both of us as we've been able to explore a range of interests we've had that that we might otherwise not have been able to engage with as much in the past.

Moving forward we'd like to continue working on this energy monitor prototype, developing the circuit further to use a different microcontroller with an integrated ESP332 moudule, which would allow us to consolidate hardware into a mich smaller package, as well as publish the recieved energy information to our Node-Red Dashboard and our friendly energybot Dan.

Building on this we'd like to create a custom PCB that integrates all the individual components we've used onto one board, and do a bit of old fanished product design to create an appealing and usable casing that would faciliate an intuitive user experience and actually look like a consumer facing product.

We plan to develop a few prototypes that we could send to some volunteer Alpha testers, where we could then engage with our community through user led design feedback to better improve both Dan the energy bot and our energy monitor, to be able to investigate further our research idea of reducing consumption without lowering the quality of life of the people that use our systems.
