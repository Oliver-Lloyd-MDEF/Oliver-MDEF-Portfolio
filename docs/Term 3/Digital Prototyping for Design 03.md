This module is all about learning how to use different kinds of fabrication technologies for prototyping in all its forms, and then over a series of week long design tasks, we have to put the theory we learn into practice. We work with both traditional forms of fabrication (e.g. laser cutters, 3D printers, welding etc) but also with new and emerging forms of fabrication where we explore the potential of growing materials, manufacturing biomaterials and incorporating living organisms into our prototyping. 

What follows are a series of entries, summarising the different design tasks, the design & thought process we went through, what we‚Äôve learnt in each task and where it could go in the future. 

I hope you enjoy reading about them, all the files you‚Äôd need and recipes to make the materials are available for each challenge so that you can follow along or improve on the designs as you explore.  

Enjoy üòÉ

## A first attempt at making furniture from scratch

For this task we had to come together in groups to design and fabricate some furniture using the large CNC router for our classroom. Together with Nuria and Carmen we decided to combine our resources to create a large shelving unit that could be used to store the weird and wonderful collections of things and prototypes that our class had managed to accumulate throughout the year.

<figcaption> Our initial concept sketch, we imagined being able to assemble a shelving unity with absolutely no fastening screws to make it as easy as possible </figcaption>

One of our main goals was always to keep it as simple to manufacture as we could. Our first design used a series of slots that would allow each piece to slide into the other securing it into place. At first this seemed like a solid strategy as it meant that it would need very little assembly time or extra fastening components like nuts and bolts. 

> Using Fusion 360 and Rhino to model up our different ideas was a quick and easy way to visualise them both on screen and in augmented reality but exporting the files as .USDZ file types, something I highly recommend if you want to quickly understand the scale of whatever it is you are designing! üòÉ

However, we quickly realised that we‚Äôd designed this thinking that we had more material than we actually did, sending us back to the drawing board to redesign the unit for the second time. 

We opted to go for an L-shaped design that would fit within our material constraints yet still work with the original fastening mechanism we‚Äôd imagined, while also allowing us to maximise the storage space we could have.

However, once we took this design in for review, we were told (and probably should have realised) that this structure on it‚Äôs own without any other fasteners would be unstable, as there was too much space on either side of the vertical slats, which would create an imbalance and potentially topple over the unit. *Not so great.*

So after some back and forth with one of our teachers (thank you Adai üôè) we settled on a new fastening system and a third and more stable design. We opted for modular and stackable boxes, would would fit within our material constraints and would allow us to make an infinitely repeatable structure to create any kind of shape we wanted.

Using an online tool called Makercase, we were able to quickly streamline the process of making the required shapes, and then edit as needed to create the right fastening slots ‚Äî in this case T-Slots. 

We included small patterned holes in which we could insert some dowels to support shelves inside each of our cubes, taking inspiration from the way Ikea do their shelving as well. 

We did however encounter some issues with the CNC machine itself, while we‚Äôd designed our shelving to be milled by an M4 bit, we learned that had been broken just before we headed down to the machine, so that required a quick bit of design change and then we were good to go. The T-slot positioning was adjusted to create structural pressure from all sides and when that was done we were finally ready to mill out our shelves. 

This was a really fun project, I was excited to be able to experience using a large CNC milling machine like this as this was something completely new to me, and I really enjoyed the experience of designing something from scratch and bringing it to life through fabrication, I‚Äôd been missing doing that for a bit so I‚Äôm very glad we got the chance to do it again. These are new skills that I will definitely use in the future, and should really come in handy for helping to create whatever exhibition space we need for the MDEF Fest.
