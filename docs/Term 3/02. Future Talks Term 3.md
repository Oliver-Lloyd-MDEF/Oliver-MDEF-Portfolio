## Helen Torres  ~ Donna Haraway and the Antrhopocene

!!! Note "**Too Long Didn't Read**"
 
        Helen Torres, a translator and educator well-versed in Donna Haraway’s work, led a class exploring the concept of “Response-ability,” which challenges traditional paradigms such as human exceptionalism and emphasizes ethical responses to environmental issues. She critiqued the Anthropocene concept for overgeneralizing human impact, instead highlighting the importance of symbiotic relationships and the interconnectedness of life through concepts like "Holobionts" and "Sympoeisis." Using the MACBA Expansion Project as a real-world example, Torres illustrated the necessity of inclusive decision-making that considers both human and non-human stakeholders.

[Helen Torres](https://ivam.es/es/presentes/video/) is a Sociologist, Educator and Translator, who found a like mind in the work of [Donna Haraway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donna_Haraway) and American professor of Human Consciousness and Feminist Studies at the University of California. Helen began to translate Haraway’s work into Spanish for release, and knows the most about Haraway’s work short of Donna Haraway herself. 

Helen’s class was focused on laying out and overviewing Haraway’s work, focusing on the key theme of our individual and collective “***Response - ability”***. ******During the talk, Helen framed the discussion through 3 main questions:

- *How can we imagine a better future when the old paradigms of human exceptionalism, individualism and autonomy are not good enough to understand the challenges of living and dying on a damaged planet?*
- *How can we practice the arts of living in multispecies worlds?*
- *How do we take care of each other, humans and non humans, rendering each other capable?*

> ***The act of “Response - ability” is our ability to actively and ethically respond to the issues of our environment, underscoring the interconnectedness of life and the necessity for decisions that consider more than just human needs.***
> 

These questions were aimed at challenging traditional paradigms, questioning how we can envision a better future that moves beyond human exceptionalism, individualism, and autonomy. These outdated concepts, she argued, are inadequate for understanding the complexities of living and dying on a damaged planet.

Helen critiqued the term Anthropocene, (the time period on the planetary timeline considered to be when humans collectively have had an undeniable impact on the environment we inhabit) arguing against the seemingly common idea that humanity as a collective whole is the main problem affecting our planet as an unfair generalisation of human impact on the Earth. She highlighted how Haraway points out that not all peoples of the earth have lived the same lives and participated in the same problems of the world, therefore failing as a universal concept of responsibility. As the actions of a relatively small number of people in history (when compared with the rest) and the issues that they have caused should not be placed squarely at the feet of every human individual. 

Instead, she emphasized the importance of understanding the pervasive presence of symbiotic relationships that define our existence. Helen discussed the terms "Holobionts" and "Sympoeisis." Holobionts are described as symbiotic assemblages that represent dynamic knots of relationships within ecosystems. Sympoeisis, or "making-with," challenges the notion of self-organization by emphasizing that beings and systems are co-created interdependently within complex networks. 

This further emphasised the concept of multispecies coexistence. Helen explored how we might practice the arts of living in a world that is not solely human but is shared with multiple species. This involves nurturing relationships that extend beyond humans to include non-human beings, emphasizing a shared existence and mutual care.

Lastly, Helen emphasized the importance of "staying with the trouble," which involves engaging in creative and unexpected collaborations, termed "making oddkin." This approach advocates forming relationships and alliances that might not typically occur, focusing on cooperative survival and flourishing in the face of environmental and societal challenges. Through these themes, Torres articulated a vision for living responsibly and ethically in a world that is intricately connected and facing numerous challenges.

Helen situated these topics into a real world example, using the proposed [MACBA Expansion Project](https://www.salirporbarcelona.com/en/no-to-the-macba-expansion-raval-neighbors/) to highlight how multiple actors and stakeholders, from politicians, neighbours, the museum itself, the skaters who use the area to express their culture, to the animals like dogs ,cats and birds that call the area their home need to have their needs considered and accounted for. 

She encouraged us to explore this topic through playful interaction, where we held a discussion as personifications of the different stakeholder groups to try and reach a consensus that would make everyone happy, to emphasise the importance of community inclusion in decision making. Helen used this activity to push us to begin to develop and nurture a deeper awareness of the interconnection we all share, and to take this into account as we begin to work towards actively respond to the problems and challenges we attempt to solve.

I really enjoyed Helen’s class, I admit to not really having heard of Donna Haraway before, and to have the ideas so succinctly explained and explored in this playful manner was something I really enjoyed, even if there were some ideas (*like Holobionts)* that I found somewhat challenging to understand. What I found myself agreeing with the most (*and is something that I have always found myself exasperated with*) is both Helens’ and Haraway’s rejection of the notion of Anthropocene as a collective problem, undoubtedly human impact has had an impact on the Earth, but to lay this at the feet of every single human on Earth is foolish, short sighted and alarmingly defeatist (I believe). While we are not solely responsible for everything, I think we are one of the few species (as of right now) capable of understanding and contextualising our symbiotic relationship that we share with the rest of the organisms on this Earth, and are therefore perfectly suited to shape our actions to better regenerate this relationship. 

***Small localised actions can lead to big systemic changes.*** 

This idea is what has become central to me for my project research, and while I’m still unsure of the final outcome and what it will be, I know that this idea is going to be a core message of it.
