Hi! I'm Oliver, I enjoy working on and designing solutions centered around sustainability and the circular economy, all while fitting the needs of the user. My passion for design spans across both physical and digital, finding the right tool for the right job.
I am currently studying on the Master's in Design for Emergent Futures (MDEF) course in Barcelona at the Institute of Advanced Architecture of Catalonia (IAAC) and Elisava Design School.
This is a web portfolio and documentation of everything I am going to be working over the course of the MDEF course here in Barcelona. 
I hope you enjoy it!
