TL;DR: In the Design Studio 01 lecture, we delved into first-person participation in prototyping, emphasizing active stakeholder engagement and considering the impact on both humans and non-human entities. Through redesigning a classmate's project, I grasped the significance of different prototyping roles. We explored Weak Signals, unexplored research areas, using the Atlas of Weak Signals toolkit, fostering collaborative thinking and self-reflection. Creating my own Atlas challenged me but encouraged unconventional thinking. Documenting design and navigating multiscalar design spaces were essential, leading to a deeper understanding of my role in shaping a sustainable future as a designer.

## Perspectives and Prototyping

Our Design Studio 01 lecture delved into the concept of first-person participation in prototyping. We were given a comprehensive explanation of what 1PP entails, emphasizing its role in encouraging active engagement in the research process. The session stressed the importance of involving stakeholders throughout the design project, ensuring that the end product aligns with its intended users. Moreover, we learned to consider the impact of our designs not only on humans but also on non-human entities like plants and animals, emphasizing a collaborative and non-extractive approach to information gathering. During group activities, I had the opportunity to redesign a classmate's project, transforming a low-cost camera trap into a more efficient, data-driven tool for conservationists. This experience broadened my understanding of different prototyping roles and their significance in generating innovative solutions.

## Searching for Signals, an introduction to the Atlas of Weak Signals

The following day, we delved into the intriguing concept of Weak Signals during an interactive session. These signals represented unexplored areas of research, offering a glimpse into potential future trends. Through a gamified approach, we explored emergent weak signals and brainstormed diverse solutions, fostering collaborative thinking and self-reflection. The experience with the Atlas of Weak Signals toolkit was eye-opening, encouraging us to challenge norms and explore unconventional ideas. This approach, I felt, should be introduced at earlier stages of education, especially for design students, as it prompts critical questioning and innovative thinking.

Subsequently, we engaged in creating our own Atlas of Weak Signals, a personalized space for gathering ideas and influences. This exercise was initially challenging but ultimately rewarding, encouraging me to think outside the box and consider unconventional pathways in my design process. In another lecture, Pablo guided us through documenting design, emphasizing the importance of persistently documenting our work. Overcoming challenges related to website creation, I felt motivated to enhance my technical skills and showcase my projects effectively.

Throughout the week we continued exploring Weak Signals, refining our Atlases, and delving into multiscalar design spaces. Evaluating each other's Atlases and creating multiscalar design diagrams proved enlightening, albeit challenging initially. However, as I grasped the concept of visualizing connections through mind maps, the process became more intuitive. This approach allowed me to create a personal design space, a dynamic mind map interlinking various ideas, concepts, and resources. This visual representation empowered me to explore abstract concepts like long-termism and connect them to tangible research areas, such as developing bio-materials for additive manufacturing.

In essence, these exercises aimed to provide a panoramic view of our ideas, enabling us to comprehend the bigger picture while not losing sight of the actionable steps we could take. The visual idea board became a valuable tool, allowing me to navigate the complex landscape of design with clarity and purpose. Through these experiences, I gained a deeper understanding of my role as a designer and the potential impact my work could have on shaping a sustainable and innovative future.
