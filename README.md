# Welcome! 

Hi! :) 

This is the repository that contains all the content seen on my MDEF portfolio website, feel free to look through the files, read the articles and jsut have a general poke around. This repository gets updated weekly as I add articles and reflections on my experiences of the different modules and classes of the Master's, as well as more documentation on the progress of my final Masters Thesis research.

This site was built using a template created by the team at Fablab Barcelona for the Master's in Design for Emergent Futures program, you can find out more about that below.

Thanks for checking out the site!
