They what we would be focusing on this semester and in the beginning the amount of work ahead of us seemed overwhelming and for a moment I thought \u201cshit, have I bitten off more than I can chew here?\u201d however, we were reminded that we are not designing alone and that we have the support of our peers, we are all in the same boat and our diverse backgrounds, ranging from politics, environmental conservation, business, and design is precisely what will see us through the programme, as everyone has a wealth of expertise and experience to offer that will always lend a new perspective or angle.  </p> <p>We also met Laura, the third director of the program, who has a PhD in Philosophy. Although some of her concepts went over my head, I am excited to learn more. We took part in an exercise where we brought an item that held personal meaning to us and placed it in the context of epistemic knowledge theories. This exercise aimed to encourage vulnerability and sharing among the group. I shared my backpack, which symbolizes adventure, knowledge, and reminds me of my partner, who gave it to me. </p> <p>Throughout the lecture, I found myself trying to plan my interventions and visualize the work to be done, but I realized that it was distracting me from being present in the moment. The faculty members are supportive and enthusiastic about helping us grow as creatives. The program seems to be constantly evolving and pushing the boundaries of design education.</p> Objects of meaing lecture and exercise <p>04/10/23 - Faculty Research areas and Poblenou Tour</p> <p>The day started with lectures from Guillem and Tomas, who shared their projects, research focus, and the impact they are making. The range of projects was inspiring, from sustainable hydrogen production to noise reduction smart citizen kits. The Fablab and Fabcity projects stood out for their innovative approach to rapid prototyping and design for the majority. After the lectures, we had a tour of Poblenou led by Chiara, one of our faculty members. We visited various projects and foundations in the area, including Biciclot, Bioma, Transfolabs, and Gallery.</p> <p>05/10/2023 - Documenting Design intro, building with Gitlab and Classroom rearranging with mini fablab</p> <p>The day began with a class on documenting design taught by Pablo Zuolaga, a former MDEF alumni. Pablo emphasized the importance of keeping a comprehensive log of our projects and creative work. He shared examples of how documenting his process opened new opportunities for him. Pablo highlighted the use of pictures and videos to make documentation engaging and provided insights on storytelling through project documentation. We were encouraged to keep a log of our daily activities as a way to track our thoughts, feelings, and processes. </p> <p>Later, Josep Marti taught us how to create a personal portfolio website using Github and Gitbash. Although I struggled with the setup, I found the idea of coding my own website exciting and empowering (though as of the time of this writing I have only just got my head round how to code this bloody site properly \u2014thanks to ChatGPT). Afterwards, we  spent time rearranging the classroom to better suit our needs then headed down to Fablab on the ground floor and as a group (definitely looked like too many cooks in the kitchen, though if you looked close enough you\u2019d actually see a well oiled machine of naive joy at work) we built a series of workbenches to create  a mini fablab in the classroom. It was a collaborative effort that allowed us to see how we would work together and forge a stronger bond amongst our small cohort \ud83d\ude03.</p> building a mini fablab for the classroom <p>06/10/23 - Exploring Elisava Design School Campus and Faculty member Laura\u2019s Research background</p> <p>We visited the Elisava campus and received an introduction to the facilities. It was impressive to see the high-tech resources available to us. Laura Benitez, the third director of our program and a doctor in philosophy, gave a lecture on her research background. She covered topics such as biohacking, trans and post humanism, and transfeminism. While some concepts were difficult to grasp, I look forward to delving deeper into her research. It seems that her lectures will focus on introspection and exploring our fight, purpose, and creative development in relation to emerging futures.</p> <p> Intro lecture to the Elisava graphics room</p>"},{"location":"term1/02-Design%20Studio%2001%20-%20Roles%20of%20Prototyping%20in%20First%20Person%20Person%20Perspectives.html","title":"Roles of Prototyping in First Person Person Perspective (1PP) Research through Design","text":"<p>Created: October 9, 2023 10:23 AM</p>  TL;DR:    This article delves into the First Person Perspective (1PP) in design, which emphasizes active engagement in research and development, critical assessment of problem-solving efforts, and involvement of stakeholders and the environment.

We were trying to give an analogue machine a digital brain. After some trial and error it worked! we are able to sideload some instructions onto our system that would allow the circuit to turn on and off on a 10 second timer. Connected via a relay, we are able to control exactly when and how the motors would turn on, the next task (which I assume is coming later in the week) is to figure out a way to separate both motors from each other, as right now, the induction motor we salvaged which was originally used to spin the cooling fan splits the high level of voltage coming from the AC power supply into a two separate streams, with the fan motor pulling the majority of the voltage and leaving 30V over to power the motor that originally span the plate inside the microwave. However, while this is really useful inside a microwave, it means that currently the plate motor can only spin when the fan motor is on. So in our quest to create an almost useful machine \u2014 in our case we\u2019ve been thinking of turning the microwave into a spinning disco light \u2014 we have to deal with a motor that will only work if the other is powered on and running, which might or might not turn out to be useful.

We really leaned into the idea at first and as we began exploring into what we could make we decided to see what else we could come up with. A bunch of ideas were tossed around, from a party in a box that would spray glitter everywhere once you opened the microwave door to a multicoloured dome that would rotate around the light in the microwave for different moods. Eventually we settled on the idea of creating an \u201canti microwave\u201d that would actively cool your food from above via the cooling fan as you attempted to eat it from the spinning plate below. The whole thing would be supported on a frame that you would have to reach around and make it difficult to eat. </p> <p>The idea behind it was to create a feeling frustration while eating, frustration at the difficulty of getting at the food and frustration at the fact that your food was actively being cooled while you ate. In a round about way we are trying to create something that allows you to empathise with people who may struggle to eat in a normal way, so it takes them much longer to do so, meaning the food gets cold and unpleasant to eat.  </p> <p>We mocked up a quick idea of how it could work, tested out how we would attach some of our components to the whole system and then presented it to the class for feedback and evaluation from the group. After which we sat down and tried to make a quick plan for how next week is going to go down, when we are going to build everything, film everything (oh yeah, we also have to shoot a 1 minute film for the product to show how it works \u2014 that\u2019s going to be great fun we have some cracking ideas for that) and how we are going to split our time within the group based on our strengths. </p> <p></p> <p>I\u2019m looking forward to it, we are going to have a great time.

All of us had different skill sets, with some coming from more hands on, build stuff and break stuff design backgrounds (definitely me) and others having a more logistical and organisational background. We managed to collaborate and play off our skills to work together and build something really fun. </p> <p>When we first presented the concept for our idea, we wanted to create something that mimicked the struggle to eat, but as we developed the concept of a reverse microwave, we discovered that our concept wouldn\u2019t allow us to get to exactly what we wanted, so we adapted. After discovering that we couldn\u2019t give our AC components any more of a brain with Arduino than just turning it on or off for a period of time, we decided to run two separate circuits. The normal AC one that powered the cooling fan and the plate motor, and a separate DC circuit that would allow us to control a lighting and sound system, designed to illuminate the food with a cool blue light and play a really annoying high pitched sound that would only start when the food was placed down on the rotating plate. </p> <p>Because you obviously have to have a sound that plays to alert you that your food is being cooled down no? </p> <p>We scavenged some more parts from our original microwave chassis, specifically the bottom panel of the casing that supported a rotating ring that allowed the plate to spin, so that we didn\u2019t have to make a new one, as well as switch to activate the whole system when weight was added to the plate.

Acting as an exercise in building for an unknown objective. We were presented with a list the 16 basic human desires (as determined by researchers from the dark arts of motivational psychology \u2014 about which you can read more here) from which we were to pick one that either we resonated with or disagreed with, and then build a machine that would work towards or against that desire. These machines didn\u2019t have to necessarily work (as all we had with us were rough recycled materials) but were more there to represent an idea \u2014 hence the term magic machines. </p> <p>These machines were then going to become companions in our lives for the rest of the week, to see for ourselves how we would interact with them on a day to day basis, and whether or not they succeeded in making us feel the way we wanted them too.</p> <p>Emotional Balance</p> <p>Out of the 16 basic human desires, I chose Tranquillity. Something that resonated quite deeply with me and was something that I wanted to explore a bit further \u2014 how can I create something that either represents or enhances tranquillity in my own day to day life?  </p> <p>With that in mind, I ended up with making a simple set of scales (albeit not very good ones now in hindsight) out of two aluminium cans, some scrap wood, the bottom of an egg carton and some twine. One side representing positive emotions and the other negative ones. </p> <p>As you went about your day you would place a marble in either the positive or negative can and over time you\u2019d be able to notice if an imbalance in your emotional state was starting to take place, with a visual reminder acting as soft cue to try and restore some balance by encouraging you to stop and reflect for a moment.  </p> <p>Why?</p> <p>when trying to come up with my machine, I ended up thinking about how much of what is happening in the world can feel very negative, throwing us off balance and being immersed in so many negative emotions (whether we notice them or not) can make life a very difficult place to be, and sometimes a visual reminder to find your equilibrium is just what\u2019s needed.</p> <p>Because It\u2019s easy to slip into extremes when that\u2019s all that you see around you, and having a visual indicator of the emotions surrounding you can be a reminder to go and do something that makes you genuinely happy and brings you some joy (whatever that may be) can help you bring some balance back to your life.

From there we had to commit to a 24 hour challenge of living within that idea and document our experience on it. </p> <p>I\u2019m really interested in designing for a sustainable future guided by long termism and regenerative and circular design principles. I\u2019d come across the concept of the 2000 watt society, which is an idea posed by some researchers in Zurich that suggests limiting the average individual energy consumption to 2000 watts to achieve a sustainable society, while ensuring that there is no perceived loss in quality of life through an emphasis on energy efficiency, renewable energy sources, and lifestyle changes to reduce overall energy consumption. You can read more about that here. </p> <p>This seemed like a really interesting idea, so I wanted to explore how I could live those changes in my own life and note down what problems (if any) that I encountered. </p> <p>How and Why</p> <p>I decided to split my 24 hours into two halves, the first 12 hours I would change nothing, and simply note down everything that I used that consumed electricity, how long I used it for and using a simple formula, calculate how much power I\u2019d consumed using each machine. After adding it all up together, see if I was over the usage limit and then adjust my habits for the next 12 hours to see if I could stay under the limit and see how it affected me. </p> <p>The formula: Energy Consumption (Wh)=(\u2211Power Rating of Device (W)\u00d7Duration of Use (h)) </p> <p>It turned out that on that particular day when I summed everything up (probably not everything I used but a close guestimate) I was over the limit by 1440 watts as my fridge ate up all the power allocation for the day immediately at 2000 watts of power just on its own over the course of a day of using it, but without it I was actually actually under the 2000 watt usage limit, coming in at a solid 1440 watts! So, knowing full well that for this experiment I couldn\u2019t just \u201cuse the fridge less, or unplug it\u201d I wanted to make it even more of a challenge and see if I could stay under a 1000 watts of energy usage for the day. </p> <p>This meant doing a quick bit of maths to try and see where I could get some energy reduction without it impacting my life in a way that would normally make me want to stop doing it or affect me being able to go about my day of classes. With a bit of tweaking to laptop charger usage times, coffee machine, television and public transport usage I was able to contain my consumption to under 1000 watts. </p> <p></p> planning and outcome of the challenge <p> </p> <p>Lifestyle Changes</p> <p>I had to reduce the amount of public transport I took, which just encouraged more walking, and honestly, it really didn\u2019t affect my life much at all, it was quite fun trying to get into the nitty gritty of working around these limits. </p> <p>Involving yourself</p> <p>Now that being said, if I was going to continue doing this living under 2000 watts challenge, I would definitely need to get far pickier with all my appliances, starting with the fridge, and I can already see that from the amount of work I had to put in just at the beginning to document everything (which was a bit of a pain) most people probably wouldn\u2019t do it (heck I probably wouldn\u2019t either). But that\u2019s great though, as it now creates some really interesting paths to explore, to ask questions like: </p> <p>What if all our devices had a little display on them that showed you their power usage constantly so you could keep track? </p> <p>Could you use internet of things to create an ecosystem where products talk to each other and cycle their power systems autonomously so that other devices in the network can draw the energy that they need? </p> <p>and many many more. </p> <p>These are questions that I wouldn\u2019t have discovered really if I had just been looking the concept from the outside, sure I might have ended up going down the same line of inquiry at some point after much theoretical explanation, but really living it, even for such a short time, was enough to immediately highlight some of the challenges and areas of opportunity that can develop into new and exciting \u201cHow might we\u201d questions and routes of investigation. </p> <p>final Thoughts</p> <p>First person perspective is definitely a useful tool in the designers toolkit, and when applied correctly can lead to some really valuable insights at the beginning of a design project.

I was interested (and still am to this day) in exploring how we can change the value proposition around traditional waste material. How can we design products and services that are easy to repair so they aren\u2019t seen as waste, or how can we reuse waste from food industries to create new biomaterials for products?</p> <p>I joined forces with some of my classmates, Carmen, Carlotta and Minhea. We all shared an interest in reframing waste as a valuable material supply, from recycling concrete to creating biomaterials and changing policy.</p> <p>We then sat down to create a shared digital design space for our particular group interests to see if we could all find something to work together on.</p> <p>This was a valuable way for us to get all our ideas out on paper. It encouraged us to have conversations around what we actually considered to be waste ourselves, what our different ideas were around how we should go about preventing waste or recovering value from it, and how we wanted to explore it ourselves.</p> <p>Initially, we struggled to come up with an idea as to what kind of intervention we could make in the time that we had, as waste is such a colossal topic! But Roger reminded us that an intervention doesn\u2019t have to be the \u201cbe all end all\u201d solution; it doesn\u2019t even have to be a solution; it can be a stepping stone in part of your design research that helps lead to deeper and more interesting questions that provide the insight you need to get the real solution at the end of the tunnel. After that, we settled on trying to aim for a more reflective approach, where we would create some form of activity that we could do with members of the public to get their perceptions around waste and how we could try and change their view on it.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"term1/06-Design%20Studio%2002%20-%20Our%20first%20Intervention.html#our-first-design-intervention","title":"Our first design intervention","text":"<p>This intervention ended up completely different from what we had initially thought we wanted to do. We always had the aim of making a reflective activity that people could take part in that would challenge their ideas around what waste would be, but the path we travelled to get there was completely different to what I thought we would do.</p> <p>Our first plan was to host a workshop where participants could make their own biomaterial from household organic waste products and turn it into something useful. And to do that, we had to test out if it was even possible to create any sort of useful material in your kitchen.</p> <p></p> <p>So we got together one crisp Saturday morning to do just that, meeting in the biolab in the IAAC building to cook up a variety of materials based on recipes we found from Materiom (one of my favourite resources; learn more about them here) along with a few other sources.</p> <p>During this exploration, while we were cooking and discussing, we realised that this topic was far too broad and not something that could easily be condensed into a 1-hour workshop and that this process was going to far too long and not create the kind of impact we were looking for.</p> <p>So we pivoted.</p> <p>We returned to the drawing board and tried to come up with something new. After some time, we came across the work done by a group here in Barcelona called Domestic Data Streamers. They hosted all sorts of exhibitions with data gathered from people in entertaining and interactive ways that created the kind of reflection we wanted. So we tried our hand at this; we decided to make some interactive questions and host informal Q&amp;A sessions with the people living here in Barcelona.</p> <p>Starting with a primary survey we sent out, we wanted to get a rough feel for what people thought about some basic questions around waste and value. Asking things like what would you consider waste? And how have you repurposed your waste, if at all? And many more; you can take a look at the original survey here.</p> <p>Asking these questions helped us to look for the deeper questions in the answers we received. From these answers, we landed on 3 key questions we wanted to know the answer to:</p> <ul> <li>what they considered to be waste</li> <li>what they wanted to change themselves</li> <li>What was holding them back from making a change?</li> </ul> <p>These questions would be answered with a sticker represneting one of two statements, so we were actually getting an answer to two questions in one!</p> <p></p> <p>With these questions in mind, we created our interactive posters, stuck them to some large pieces of cardboard we found (very low-tech, I know) and proceeded with our intervention. We hung a set of posters up in our own university building to see what the reactions and responses would be from people who we thought would be the most likely to be aware of and working towards solutions around these issues and the next, we took around Barcelona with us!</p> <p>We wandered around the neighbourhood of Gracia, inviting strangers to participate in our research and see what they had to say. While this was initially a little nerve-racking, we got over it, and soon, we were chatting with people left and right and getting some fantastic insights. I\u2019m glad we took this approach; the answers we got and our conversations really painted an interesting picture that we wouldn\u2019t have gotten otherwise if we\u2019d done something else. Turns out most people are trying their hardest to repurpose the majority of their plastic waste into other useful things around their home and life, as well as turning as much food waste as they can into compost for their plants!</p> <p></p> <p>That was definitely different from what I was expecting.</p> <p>Overall, it was a fascinating data-gathering exercise. I\u2019m happy now that I think I have a better understanding of what a design intervention is and how it can be used to begin to create the alternative presents we want to achieve.

This was really helpful, as it helped to give me a clearer picture as to how I was going to try and build this site and write the articles within them that you are reading right now (so I hope you are enjoying it, feedback is always appreciated \ud83d\ude03) </p> <p>I\u2019m looking forward to putting it all together to look just how I want it to.  </p> <p>Though the task after that has proven to remain the most challenging, actually building the site itself\u2026</p>"},{"location":"term1/07-Documenting%20Design.html#an-introduction-to-coding-websites","title":"An introduction to coding websites","text":"<p>A day or so before this class, we\u2019d received an intro from one of our teachers, Josep Marti; he taught us how to set up our basic website skeleton through Git, hosted on the open source platform Github, and created with the MKdocs framework and Material theme written in the markdown language with a sprinkle of HTML and CSS. </p> <p>If those all sounded like big words that meant a bunch of nonsense, don\u2019t worry, I was (and in some cases still am) in the same situation. </p> <p>Essentially we were given a very quick crash course into the world of web development, which was both exciting and at times rage-inducing. Nevertheless, we are still here, and I\u2019m excited to learn a bit about this field of digital creation. </p> <p>I\u2019m starting to get the hang of this stuff now, I think, especially with the help of my new best friend, ChatGPT. That tool has probably supercharged my learning around how to code this website from scratch 100x, and for something like this, where it\u2019s learning by doing on the fly, it\u2019s one of the most useful companions you could have.  </p> <p>I\u2019ve also started to document some of the little fixed snippets of code I\u2019ve written or discovered that perform certain functions or aesthetic changes so that my classmates can use it as a resource when creating their own sites should they need to because there is absolutely no sense in everyone having to go through the exact same struggle all over again. </p>"},{"location":"term1/07-Documenting%20Design.html#making-it-make-sense","title":"Making it make sense","text":"<p>Now I\u2019m down to trying to keep the site updated as frequently as possible, which has become more accessible and easier each time; I\u2019m discovering little hacks or lines of HTML and CSS that can perform even better functions than just what markdown can handle on its own. </p> <p>I\u2019m glad I stuck to trying to learn how to build this documentation site from scratch instead of relying on a template builder like Mobirise; while a tool like that gives you access to far more features, both aesthetically and functionally, I\u2019m happy to try and push myself to learn this now, as honestly I don\u2019t think I\u2019d find the time to do it at any other point in the near future. </p> <p>Every day, I get distracted by another little tweak I could make here or an image styling update there to get the site to look exactly as I want, something I feel is going to continue throughout the entire year (hopefully, it doesn\u2019t distract me too much from the actual work we are doing but oh well\u2026that means that you are starting to have fun with it \ud83d\ude03) </p> <p>For now I think I\u2019m happy with how it looks, just a few more image tweaks to try and solve\u2026.</p>"}]}
