They what we would be focusing on this semester and in the beginning the amount of work ahead of us seemed overwhelming and for a moment I thought \u201cshit, have I bitten off more than I can chew here?\u201d however, we were reminded that we are not designing alone and that we have the support of our peers, we are all in the same boat and our diverse backgrounds, ranging from politics, environmental conservation, business, and design is precisely what will see us through the programme, as everyone has a wealth of expertise and experience to offer that will always lend a new perspective or angle. We also met Laura, the third director of the program, who has a PhD in Philosophy. Although some of her concepts went over my head, I am excited to learn more. We took part in an exercise where we brought an item that held personal meaning to us and placed it in the context of epistemic knowledge theories. This exercise aimed to encourage vulnerability and sharing among the group. I shared my backpack, which symbolizes adventure, knowledge, and reminds me of my partner, who gave it to me. Throughout the lecture, I found myself trying to plan my interventions and visualize the work to be done, but I realized that it was distracting me from being present in the moment. The faculty members are supportive and enthusiastic about helping us grow as creatives. The program seems to be constantly evolving and pushing the boundaries of design education. 04/10/23 - Faculty Research areas and a tour of Poblenou The day started with lectures from Guillem and Tomas, who shared their projects, research focus, and the impact they are making. The range of projects was inspiring, from sustainable hydrogen production to noise reduction smart citizen kits. The Fablab and Fabcity projects stood out for their innovative approach to rapid prototyping and design for the majority. After the lectures, we had a tour of Poblenou led by Chiara, one of our faculty members. We visited various projects and foundations in the area, including Biciclot, Bioma, Transfolabs, and Gallery. 05/10/2023 - Documenting Design, building with Gitlab and building a mini fablab in our classroom. The day began with a class on documenting design taught by Pablo Zuolaga, a former MDEF alumni. Pablo emphasized the importance of keeping a comprehensive log of our projects and creative work. He shared examples of how documenting his process opened new opportunities for him. Pablo highlighted the use of pictures and videos to make documentation engaging and provided insights on storytelling through project documentation. We were encouraged to keep a log of our daily activities as a way to track our thoughts, feelings, and processes. Later, Josep Marti taught us how to create a personal portfolio website using Github and Gitbash. Although I struggled with the setup, I found the idea of coding my own website exciting and empowering (though as of the time of this writing I have only just got my head round how to code this bloody site properly \u2014thanks to ChatGPT). Afterwards, we spent time rearranging the classroom to better suit our needs then headed down to Fablab on the ground floor and as a group (definitely looked like too many cooks in the kitchen, though if you looked close enough you\u2019d actually see a well oiled machine of naive joy at work) we built a series of workbenches to create a mini fablab in the classroom. It was a collaborative effort that allowed us to see how we would work together and forge a stronger bond amongst our small cohort \ud83d\ude03. 06/10/23 - Exploring Elisava Design School Campus and Faculty member Laura\u2019s Research background We visited the Elisava campus and received an introduction to the facilities. It was impressive to see the high-tech resources available to us. Laura Benitez, the third director of our program and a doctor in philosophy, gave a lecture on her research background. She covered topics such as biohacking, trans and post humanism, and transfeminism. While some concepts were difficult to grasp, I look forward to delving deeper into her research. It seems that her lectures will focus on introspection and exploring our fight, purpose, and creative development in relation to emerging futures.","title":"Week 1 - A soft landing"},{"location":"Term%202/digi/","text":"This page will stay empty for now till we get to term 2! :D It is right now being used as a testing ground for different lines of code for different bits and pieces and styling This is an inline callout box or highlight.

Performed an exercise where we brought an item that meant something to us and placed it in the context of epistomatic knowledge theories, very difficult to understand but I think it was designed to get everyone to open up and share a little bit of vulnerability with each other. I showed my backpack, which symbolises to me a home anywhere in the world and the key to adventure and knowledge, as well as reminding me of Laia all the time as she is the one who gave it to me. Mostly spent lecture trying to visualise the work needed to be done over the course of the semester and trying to already figure out how I was going to plan my interventions - this was a bad idea, it got me focused on all the wrong things and not present in the moment. All the faculty seem really supportive and excited to help us grow as creatives and grow as creatives themselves through applying and facilitating the course. It seems like a constantly changing and developing masters which makes it really exciting. It seems like we really are on the cutting edge of design education here and pushing the boundaries of what\u2019s possible as much as possible! Faculty seem very keen on seeing us as equals and not students, and have even organised informal drinks for everyone to get to know each other. Excited to see the rest of the week and what it has in store, and curious to see what the first assignment will be - apparently building a personal blog website? Objects of meaing lecture and exercise 04/10/23 - Faculty Research areas and Poblenou Tour started the day with two different lectures from two of the course directors, Guillem & Tomas, where they told us about what projects they\u2019ve worked on, how they\u2019ve developed them and what their areas of research focus are now. this was super interesting, because the projects were so varied and seemed to really be having an impact! Ranging from areas around sustainable hydrogen production in Bali to provide clean energy to fisherman, to noise reduction smart citizen kits using open source technologies that are still produced and sold today. Mentioned a lot of inspiring things that made me think I was definitely in the right place. The Fablab and Fabcity projects really seem to be pushing the boundaries of what\u2019s possible right now with rapid prototyping. It really seemed to be pushing towards design for the other 90% not just what we do a lot right now in the western world which is design for that one 10% that can afford well designed products and services. Following that lecture, a tour of Poblenou: Chiara (one of our faculty and the rock of the programme) took us on a tour around the area we are going to be living and met some of the supporting projects and foundations that exist in the neighbourhood. What follows is a list and description of the different people and enterprises we met: Biciclot Bioma Transfolabs Gallery 05/10/2023 - Documenting Design intro, building with Gitlab and Classroom rearranging with mini fablab Day started with a morning class in documenting design (or the importance of it, it\u2019s benefits and how it will help throughout the course, our careers and our lives) taught by Pablo Zuolaga, former MDEF alumni from a few years ago. Pablo used to work as a creative lead for a marketing agency in Colombia, creating advertising campaigns for global brands around the world. taught us the importance of keeping a great log of everything we do throughout our various projects and creative work. Showing us examples from his own personal life where documenting this process and publishing is what opened new doors and opportunities that he had never even dreamed about or thought possible before! reminded us about how it can act as a great reminder and also a catalyst for creativity as you can look back on your old work, see and track your old thought processes, pick up where you left off from or notice was of thinking and doing that have now changed as you have gained new knowledge and ways of doing that maybe now mean that you are able to start up a project once again when before you had hit a roadblock and didn\u2019t know how to get any further. he stressed the importance of using pictures and videos to aid in this documentation, and gave a really great breakdown of how to tell a great story through your project documentation that makes it both interesting and engaging to read and follow along with! (hence all the pictures and videos, they do say 1000 words after all) showed us how this type of documentation was going to be assessed by him and other faculty to see how we were keeping on top of our work and our project research, which is a great way of engaging with all the student work when they can. Every week we are encoruaged to keep a log of everything that has happened on that day and turn that into a relfection or blog post or what ever you like, as a way to document everything and keep track of your thoughts, feelings and processes about the work that we are doing. funnily enough, alot of the things Pablo mentioned, i\u2019d already learned studying my Bachelors in Product Design at Bounremouth University, particularly when it focused on the importance of documenting everything in reference to a portfolio of work, which I felt really happy about as I thought that I could definitely keep on top of this through what I already know. What excited me even more though, was knowing that now I\u2019m going to learn how to really tell a good story through all this documenting, something I was never really good at before, my previous portfolios and dsign documentation have always felt really linear, following the next logical step i.e Ideation, Development, Concept selection, Testing, Refining, Detail design then implemention. Never really including any sort of problem, troubles, triumphs and failures along the way, I\u2019ve recently started to try and do this on my own to my exisitng portfolio website and to rewrite, reframe and structure it to turn it into a narrative. So having someone like Pablo (with all his knowledge in creative story telling for advertising) there to reexamine, review and bounce ideas off to further develop this side of documentation makes me really happy and I think I\u2019m going to learn a lot from this. Excited to see where this goes and how I can develop my writing further from this. In an effort to improve, i\u2019m going to try and keep my reflections brief but engaging, detgailing everything weve done and the research I am working on week by week in a blog post format that I want to start to share on other social media platforms and not just the website we are building so that it keeps me accoutnable but also hopefully engages a wider audience who might be interested in the work we do here on this masters! Following Pablo\u2019s lesson we had a course from Josep Marti (our resident expert on all things coding and digital building) on how to create, set up and develop our own personal portfolio website using Github and Gitbash. this was super interesting and the idea of learning how to write it all and code it using python scripts through Git is a really cool thing that I want to get much better at over the coming weeks. Though I admit that I fell behind in this class quite quickly as I was still figuring out all the set up for it. this is an area I definitely still need to improve on, as coding is something I never really learned before and for ages never had any interest in doing so. Though now, it\u2019s been put in a different perspective and I can see how it can actually be used to create products and services that I would use every day, and being able to do it myself gives me a real sense of ownership over the work which is great! There is still far more to learn that I don\u2019t know but with the help from my amazing classmates and Josep I think we\u2019ll get there! It\u2019s a fantastic way of learning by doing ,instead of having to watch countless hours of video or lectures on the principles behind coding and then doing it later you do it right there in class and outside of it with a real goal in mind; to develop the website that is going to host pretty much all of the documentation of the work we are going to be doing this year (and coincidentally where all our work will be marked by the faculty \u2014 so it has to work) in one place. Making sure that we really learn it as fast as possible and create something that really works out in the real world instead of just small practice problems and solutions that never get used again after that. Brilliant stuff. After that, we spent some time rearranging the classroom into an orientation that made it more comfortable to work in and developed it into a space that we could really grow into and use to suit our needs for the year. We used the fablab on theg round floor of the IAAC building to create furniture and workbenches that we were going to need to prototype various things in our classroom \u2014basically turning it into a mini fablab of it\u2019s own! everyone worked together to achieve a common goal and it was a really great way to see how we were all going to work and interact with eachother which I really enjoyed! building a mini fablab for the classroom 06/10/23 - Exploring Elisava Design School Campus and Faculty member Laura\u2019s Research background in the morning we toured around the Elisava campus (the other university we are part of and whose facilities we have access too \u2014 very cool stuff) received our welcome packs and intro lectures to how we can access and use the facilites and toured what they had on offer. it\u2019s a lot of high tech stuff but also a lot more rules than at the Fablab \u2014 there are more people they need to take care of so it makes sense. we had a lecture from Laura Benitez (the third director of our programme and a doctor in philosophy) on her research background and what areas she is focusing on now. A lot of really cool topics from Biohacking, to trans and post humanism, transfeminism and many more that went completely over my head. I think I\u2019m going to really enjoy what she has to teach us but it\u2019ll definitely take me some time to get to understand it all and really grasp the depth of her research and knowledge. seems like her lectures will be focused on asking ourselves who and what we are, what is our fight/purpose/why, why we create the way we do and how does that develop who we are as we create for these emerging futures.

Examples include: usability tests of the prototypes experiential trials to assess the design attributes such as aesthetics cases where the prototype is treated as a physical hypothesis. Role 1: The prototype as an experimental component \u00b6 Prototypes are experiments designed to test specific hypotheses that are physically embedded in the artefact. Examples are: usability tests of the prototypes, experiential trials to assess the design attributes such as aesthetics, or cases where the prototype is treated as a physical hypothesis. Role 2: The prototype as a means of inquiry \u00b6 Prototypes have been developed and deployed as instruments of inquiry, in much the way that scientists use specifically designed instruments to collect, record and measure phenomena used in the past as a method to encourage reflection on how designers need to be part of the entire lifecycle of the product, and not just ship it off to market and wash their hands of it. can be any form of inquiry, from a survey to a cardboard model etc prototyping can be done when one still doesn\u2019t know what they want to create, as it is a means to finding out knowledge and understanding about the field of research. Role 3: The prototype as a research archetype \u00b6 Research archetypes are physical embodiments of concepts, understandings or design spaces. These prototypes are principally exemplary and illustrative, even (and especially) when they are exposing confrontational or contradictory scenarios. Role 4: The process of prototyping as a vehicle for inquiry \u00b6 The process of making a prototype is instrumental in doing design research. In this role, the process becomes a means of inquiry, akin to a research method. The process is documented, analysed, critically assessed and written up, and the research contribution is tied not to the artefact itself as much as to how the artefact was crafted. Reflection & Understanding: As a designer in this program, or any design program/work actually it is important to remember that you aren\u2019t married to just one of these prototyping roles for each step of the design journey. You can use any one of them at any time to achieve the desired output, often times combing various roles to achieve what you set out to find out. These forms of prototyping are very similar to what I learned during my bachelors degree, using prototyping as a form of experimentation and play to figure out just exactly what might be the right direction to go in, creating rough models from cardstock and cardboard to alpha test usability, user interaction, sizing and place finding that can then lead you in the right direction. Activity 1 - Understanding prototyping roles and how we\u2019ve applied them in past work \u00b6 Discussing past projects and how we applied the various prototyping roles into those projects in a group activity, reflecting with others on whether or not those really were the correct prototyping roles we identified. Reflection & Understanding: important to break down the larger idea behind the project into it\u2019s smaller more focused components, this where you can identify the different prototyping roles and how they fit into the design process collaborating and discussing with others in the group to get their perspectives was really helpful and interesting, it created a much more open dialogue about past work and how to re-evaluate it for a deeper understanding really enjoyed seeing everyone else\u2019s perspectives on how they might have applied the different prototyping roles based on their different backgrounds. Discussing our various projects, what prototyping roles we used and how they could be differently applied & creating rough prototypes and mock-ups of our reinterpretations of each other\u2019s group projects. Activity 2 - Discussing and re-defining past project work with others through collaboration \u00b6 In our groups, we each described a past piece of work from our creative or professional backgrounds and what prototyping role we used within that project. Then we each picked a project from another in the group and attempted to reframe that project through the use of the other prototyping roles that could be applied to that project that were not applied the first time round. While roughly prototyping a small mock-up of our changes through rough sketching and low tech prototyping materials like paper, cardboard, popsicle sticks, tape and plenty of metaphors. From within my group I picked Albert\u2019s project (Albert is an environmental conservationist by training and vocation), his past project was a small low cost camera trap for small mammalian carnivores to allow environmental scientists to gather data on these animals and their population. The project clearly used roles 1 & 2 of prototyping in its creation and implementation, and I tried to reframe this project using Role 4, by creating a connected rough mock-up for a connected database for these traps that would allow the data to be collected, analysed and categorised in near real time by not just scientists but also normal citizens interested in taking part in citizen science. Both as a way to create a prototype that streamlined the data collection process and sped it up, but also as a way to encourage to the general populace to start asking more questions about the nature around them and realising it\u2019s importance. Reflection: this was a really interesting exercise which I struggled with in the beginning, I struggled with understanding the difference between the different roles of prototyping and how you could reframe a project through them as I have only ever known prototyping as an umbrella term for doing whatever testing or making you needed to do to collect data that will prove your idea will work, so applying this framework to my own work, let alone someone else\u2019s work was quite a thing to wrap my head around in the beginning. The exercise made me think of how I developed my past projects in completely new ways, it sort of made me unlearn a little what I thought I already knew about how to prototype and also created a new understanding of how I can look at future projects, a new lens in which to see how to best identify the most useful prototyping role or roles that could serve the best purpose for generating data that can be usefully applied to further the creative process. Which is something I really liked!

These are areas of potential research or work that have not been fully realized or defined yet. They act as indicators of emerging trends, allowing us to adapt and accommodate for potential futures. I found this concept fascinating as it enables us to identify trends before they become widely recognized and take appropriate action. We explored how Weak Signals have been used in the past and how they can be used to develop various solutions as these areas become more developed. It was interesting to see the gamified version of the methodology, which involved using a system of cards to explore emergent Weak Signals. With the guidance of Jana and Roger, we delved into these signals and identified areas of opportunity within them that could lead to different solutions. Later, we broke into smaller groups to focus on specific Weak Signal areas and brainstorm various pathways and solutions. This exercise was guided by random triggers, which helped narrow down our focus and stimulate our thinking. It was exciting to see the diverse ideas and perspectives that emerged from these group discussions. Getting familiar with the methodology in groups The toolkit used in this session was amazing. It opened up so many new pathways for out-of-the-box thinking when it comes to developing ideas. While some of the ideas generated may not be great, the point is that it encourages dialogue and collaboration among all participants. On the other hand, if done alone, it promotes introspection and reflection. Working with Weak Signals that I knew nothing about forced me to stop and think, trying to understand their meaning and significance for both myself and society as a whole. I strongly believe that this type of thinking should be taught at a much earlier level, especially during bachelor\u2019s degrees for those studying design. It encourages us to question the things that have been normalized around us and completely rejuvenates how we think of ideas. It serves as a framework for more effective and out-of-the-box thinking, which is greatly enhanced through collaboration. We then set about creating our own Atlas of Weak Signals (AoWS) in our design space drawing ideas from the AoWS card deck. This involved designing and collecting ideas, thoughts, and influences that could spark new pathways and connections. It was a challenging exercise at first, but I ended up enjoying it. It felt like creating a Pinterest board on steroids, where I could explore and document various ideas and inspirations in my design space.

It\u2019s a mirror, a tool used to define reflection and visualise unconscious experience to awareness, to question values, attitudes and perspectives we unconsciously embody as designers and creatives. It\u2019s a fluid and dynamic space that\u2019s always changing, with new ideas constantly coming in to complement existing ones or replace old and outdated ones.

These signals emphasize the importance of considering the impact of our actions on future generations and leveraging the collaborative power of humans and machines.

I concentrated on three key areas of opportunity: digital fabrication, circular economy, and material development. These areas, when harnessed effectively, have the potential to pave the way for a solarpunk future. By fostering cooperation between humans and machines, we can unlock innovative solutions in biomaterials, circular economies, and doughnut economic models. This collaboration ensures that the goals of long-termism are maintained, with a focus on creating products and policies that account for the well-being of future generations. Through localized digital fabrication hubs, we can harness the unique capabilities of both humans and machines, pushing the boundaries of innovation. This approach not only aligns with the solarpunk ethos but also contributes to the vision of a sustainable future framed by localized production, global connectivity, and a deep commitment to the well-being of all generations to come. 2 new weak signals for the Atlas: \u00b6 Going further, we had to add 2 new suggestions for the card deck, I decided to focus on two new potential weak signal areas, and landed on water conservation and climate adaptation as areas that could be designed for. 1. Climate Change Adaptation \u00b6 Climate change-related events, such as extreme weather conditions and natural disasters, pose significant risks to supply chains. Strategies for adapting to these challenges are becoming crucial weak signal areas. 2. Water Conservation \u00b6 Emerging technologies for water conservation, such as advanced filtration systems and smart irrigation techniques, signal a growing focus on preserving water resources, especially in water-scarce regions. Two new weak signals for the deck We shared and evaluated our atlases with each other in groups to help in drawing connections between ourselves and each other. It was really interesting to see the thought process behind everyone else\u2019s atlases and how they drew their connections and conclusions, even better was being able to discuss amongst ourselves and form new connections between each other as we discussed and shared ideas. Multi-scalar design diagrams: \u00b6 We then began the next exercise, creating multiscalar design diagrams. These take a weak signal and scale it up from the personal to the global scale through interesting thought triggers, connections, resources, frameworks and contexts for interventions, in an ever expanding series of rings. I focused on the weak signals I\u2019d chosen before, Long-Termism and Human Machine creative interactions. This is something that I struggled with in the beginning as I have never had to frame my thought process this way and I found it difficult in the beginning to draw connections between the different options and ideas, where to place them and how to draw connections between them, I drew a deeper understanding of creating the atlas of weak signals as a mindmap, which for me created a much easier way to visualise connections and ideas as the stages scaled up from the individual to the global. Personal Design Space: \u00b6 Finally, we ended with creating the finalised personal design space, a combination of the early atlas of weak signals design space we had created and multiscalar design diagram, allowing for connections to be drawn between various abstract ideas, concepts or resources that can help to potentially create a series of solutions to the weak signal areas we found interesting right now and maybe formed potential areas we\u2019d like to work on in the future. My design space ended up looking like a sprawling mind map, with sticky notes and arrows connecting everything in ways that I think could be useful in the future. I included a few \u201chow Might We\u201d questions that framed some of the areas I wanted to explore and tried to connect those to some of the resources, toolkits, methodologies and infrastructure I have access to right now so that I could track the stepping stones I can follow as I explore some potential areas for design interventions that could have some impact in trying to create the solarpunk future I\u2019d like to see in the future. I found doing this exercise much easier than the multiscalar design diagram, as I struggled in the beginning to try and visualise how to distribute the different areas of interest to me, but with this I was able to visualise connections and draw links much easier between different areas that on their own appeared far more abstract. These connections, in the form of a mind map that can seem a little chaotic, helped me to see links that I couldn\u2019t see before, sprawling outwards from some central ideas and that let me work backwards from abstract macro scale concepts like long-termism down to something more concrete that I can research and work towards like creating new forms of bio-materials for additive manufacturing. I much prefer creating these sorts of diagrams and working from them as they let me keep track of lots of various ideas together in one that I can then draw connections with in a visual way, rather than keeping different ideas in separate lists. I think this was the point of the exercise and creating these spaces, to create a visual idea board that you can take a step back from and see the bigger picture without losing sight of what can be done right now. I think this is going to become a very useful tool for me in the future. this was the point of the exercise and creating these spaces, to create a visual idea board that you can take a step back from and see the bigger picture without losing sight of what can be done right now.

I included a few \u201chow Might We\u201d questions that framed some of the areas I wanted to explore and tried to connect those to some of the resources, toolkits, methodologies and infrastructure I have access to right now so that I could track the stepping stones I can follow as I explore some potential areas for design interventions that could have some impact in trying to create the solarpunk future I\u2019d like to see in the future. I found doing this exercise much easier than the multiscalar design diagram, as I struggled in the beginning to try and visualise how to distribute the different areas of interest to me, but with this I was able to visualise connections and draw links much easier between different areas that on their own appeared far more abstract. These connections, in the form of a mind map that can seem a little chaotic, helped me to see links that I couldn\u2019t see before, sprawling outwards from some central ideas and that let me work backwards from abstract macro scale concepts like long-termism down to something more concrete that I can research and work towards like creating new forms of bio-materials for additive manufacturing. I much prefer creating these sorts of diagrams and working from them as they let me keep track of lots of various ideas together in one that I can then draw connections with in a visual way, rather than keeping different ideas in separate lists. I think this was the point of the exercise and creating these spaces, to create a visual idea board that you can take a step back from and see the bigger picture without losing sight of what can be done right now. I think this is going to become a very useful tool for me in the future. this was the point of the exercise and creating these spaces, to create a visual idea board that you can take a step back from and see the bigger picture without losing sight of what can be done right now.","title":"Personal Design Space:"},{"location":"term1/03-Atlas%20of%20Weak%20Signals/#you-can-take-a-more-detailed-look-at-these-design-spaces-here","text":"","title":"You can take a more detailed look at these design spaces here:"}]}
