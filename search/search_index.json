Pablo emphasized the importance of keeping a comprehensive log of our projects and creative work. He shared examples of how documenting his process opened new opportunities for him. Pablo highlighted the use of pictures and videos to make documentation engaging and provided insights on storytelling through project documentation. We were encouraged to keep a log of our daily activities as a way to track our thoughts, feelings, and processes. </p> <p>Later, Josep Marti taught us how to create a personal portfolio website using Github and Gitbash. Although I struggled with the setup, I found the idea of coding my own website exciting and empowering (though as of the time of this writing I have only just got my head round how to code this bloody site properly \u2014thanks to ChatGPT). Afterwards, we  spent time rearranging the classroom to better suit our needs then headed down to Fablab on the ground floor and as a group (definitely looked like too many cooks in the kitchen, though if you looked close enough you\u2019d actually see a well oiled machine of naive joy at work) we built a series of workbenches to create  a mini fablab in the classroom.

The term helps understand how modernization, economic development, and capitalism have contributed to these interconnected crises, including climate change, pandemics, geopolitical tensions, and democratic dysfunction.</p> <p>There are four key factors that contribute to the uniqueness of our current Polycrisis:</p> <ol> <li>Human Energy Consumption: The exponential increase in human energy consumption, primarily through fossil fuels, and its significant impact on the environment.</li> <li>Earth\u2019s Energy Balance: The importance of understanding the balance between the energy Earth receives from the sun and the energy it emits back into space. This balance is crucial for Earth\u2019s climate and is being altered by human activities.</li> <li>Anthropogenic Biomass: The concept that the total mass of human-created materials (like concrete, bricks, and other building materials) has now surpassed the total biomass of all living creatures on Earth. This shift has significant implications for the planet\u2019s ecosystems.</li> <li>Connectivity of Human Populations: The interconnectedness of the global population, not just in terms of digital communication but also through supply chains and global commerce. This interconnectedness exacerbates the impacts of crises in one area on the entire global system. Illustrated by a video on the supply chain crisis.</li> </ol> <p>It is these factors, occurring simultaneously, that represent a unique challenge in human and planetary history. </p> <p>The idea of Polycrisis resonated with me deeply. It presents a wicked problem, not just as a singular environmental crisis but as a complex web of interconnected issues without a single root cause. A design problem that cannot be solved by individual groups working in silo to achieve a single solution and then moving on to the next, but by multiple groups of interconnected people working towards and sharing information to help facilitate the transition into a better future.</p> <p>As designers, we have to take a step back and see the bigger picture. We must approach solutions considering the many ways in which different crises interact and impact one another, and the solutions we do end up creating must consider the vast scale and complexity of these interconnected problems.</p> <p> </p> An example of how we can visualise the wicked problem that is the current polycrisis, taken from the Global Risk report 2023 published by the World Economic Forum."},{"location":"Term%202/01.%20Designing%20in%20a%20State%20of%20Climate%20Emergency.html#time-and-perception","title":"Time and Perception","text":"<p>The \u201cLong Now\u201d, is a method of stretching the concept of now to the next 2,000 years and the past 2000 years, asking ourselves how are we being influenced by the past and what impact are we going to have on the future with the actions we take right now - A more long-term view </p> <p>Gustavo\u2019s lecture introduced an angle that I hadn\u2019t really considered before when it comes to design - our perception of time and its cultural interpretations. He explored how various cultures perceive time and its influence on actions and decisions. The most striking concept was \u2018positional temporality,\u2019 a notion that encourages viewing time not as a linear progression but as a 3D torus, where past, present, and future coexist and influence each other, particularly as they all return to the present moment. </p> <p>This concept encourages us all to (and this is something I wholeheartedly agree with) make design decisions that embrace a much longer timeline when considering the impact of the objects, services or policies that we create. Which hopefully allows us to make decisions (as best as we can with the information and weak signals we can identify) that ensure the artefacts we create do not have a negative effect on the environment and future generations to come when they reach their end of life.  </p> <p>This type of thinking is already being taken into consideration in the design of products through innovation in repairability, bio-based materials, modularity and subscription models, while policies like \u201cRight to Repair\u201d bills are being pushed through by the EU and California to name a couple. </p> <p>I for one, am all for it.</p> <p> </p> Reimagining time as a Torus shape rather than a linear arrow, with past and future informing eachother and coalescing in the present moment - at the centre of the doughnut"},{"location":"Term%202/01.%20Designing%20in%20a%20State%20of%20Climate%20Emergency.html#the-economics-of-degrowth","title":"The Economics of Degrowth","text":"<p>Throughout the week we held discussions on degrowth and the possibility of green growth. It was intriguing to see diverse perspectives on growth and its implications in our current economic systems. Donut economics emerged as a compelling alternative, suggesting a balance between human needs and ecological limits. </p> <p>Personally, I believe we need to have a fundamental shift in how we perceive value, and that we shouldn\u2019t base the success of a city or nation on how much Gross Domestic Product it produces, as this requires a system of constant growth which has played some part in the ecological mess we find ourselves in now. Perhaps we need to shift more towards measuring through other metrics, such as Gross National Happiness (GNH) or Thriving Places Index (TPI), by using metrics so as these we can (I believe anyway, and I could be very wrong) that we can still prosper and grow as a society while boosting economic prosperity and remain within planetary and social boundaries. </p> <p>You can find more on different indexes of prosperity here.</p> <p>These discussions fed my interest into transition design further, and got me thinking about how we could use design thinking methods to help create and improve policies that attempt to improve the welfare of everyone in a city, state or country.

We delved into the layers of environmental crises, the multifaceted nature of time, and the critical need for economic models that prioritize sustainability over mere growth.</p> <p>This journey has been about more than just absorbing information; it\u2019s been an experience that has shifted and often times reinforced some of my beliefs in the potential and responsibility of design. The idea of Polycrisis, in particular, stands out to me as a crucial framework for approaching and understanding systems and problems for future design work. </p> <p>It\u2019s no longer sufficient to tackle problems in isolation; we must adopt a holistic approach that acknowledges the interconnectedness of global challenges. </p> <p>As Andres emphasized, our role is not merely as residents of planet Earth, but as integral parts of the entire ecosystem. As we navigate the complexities of designing in a climate emergency, It\u2019s all about balancing the immediate needs with long-term sustainability, considering the cascading effects of our design choices on future generations.</p> <p>In Gustavo\u2019s exploration of time, what stuck with me the most is the idea of seeing time as a 3D torus, where past, present, and future are interwoven. This view on the flow of time has profound implications for the way we design not just products, but services and policies too. It encourages us to create with a consciousness that our present actions are future histories, thereby fostering a sense of responsibility and foresight in our designs.

The melting point of Gelatine is about 35 degrees Celsius, and anything hotter than that will cut right through it. </p>  Testing out how we might be able to seal the gelatin material  <p>We realised that to ensure a tight seal in the material, we\u2019d have to heat it to just below its melting point, enough that it became viscous enough to blend into a solid piece of material but without becoming completely liquid once again. </p> <p>The optimum temperature we discovered for this is about 30 degrees Celsius.</p> <p>The Recipe: </p> <p>To make the material, use the recipe below: </p> <p>Water: 240 ml Glycerine: 48 g Gelatine:\u00a048\u00a0g</p> <p>This is the base recipe, (for larger batches like in our case, double each ingredient amount, and keep going till you get the amount you need) In our case, we needed 4 batches so:</p> <p>Water: 960 ml Glycerine: 192 g Gelatine:\u00a0192\u00a0g</p>  All the ingredients are added into one pot on a high heat and stirred until mixed well  <p>Next, we had to cast the material into a mould to give us a large rectangular sheet. This we achieved with a large acrylic sheet to which we added a wooden lip on each side to give us a cavity to pour the gelatine mixture into without it spilling. </p> <p>You will need some kind of acrylic, silicone or glass to build this mould, using wood as a base will cause the gelatine to stick and not come out. </p> <p>Important Learning!: Let the gelatine mixture cool just a little in the pot before pouring it in, otherwise, it will cause the acrylic to warp and you\u2019ll have gelatine pouring all over the floor \u2014 as we unfortunately discovered. </p> <p>Once successfully removed, the sheet of gelatine was allowed to dry to make sure that would have enough strength to withstand being inflated while still maintaining the elasticity we needed. </p>  The mould we used for casting and the process of peeling out sheets of gelatin material  <p>Laser cutting</p> <p>As the sheet dried, we designed some templates for the air pockets in Fusion 360, saved them as .DWG files (which you can find at the bottom of this page)  and laser cut them out of baking paper(if you don\u2019t have a laser cutter you can also use scissors, it will also work just fine). </p> <p>It\u2019s important to use something like baking paper, we learned from an instructable article that the grease properties of baking paper (when placed in between two sheets of the same material) will stop two sheets of material from sticking to each other when heat is applied across the material.  </p> <p>We used this exact process to make sure our gelatine sheet didn\u2019t just congeal once more into one big solid sheet. </p>  Modelling and laser cutting the air pocket templates  <p>Putting it all together</p> <p>When the gelatine sheet was fully dry, we cut our sheet down to size, placed our templates onto one half of the sheet, folded the other half back over, making sure to leave a little exposed area as an inlet for the air, and placed our material in the heat press available in the FabLab. </p> <p>If you can\u2019t access a heat press, a hair dryer will work just as well, start on a medium heat setting and apply heat evenly over the surface of the material. make sure to place the material on another sheet of baking paper that covers both the top and bottom of the material. This makes sure it doesn\u2019t melt and stick to whatever surface you are working on. </p>  Placing the air pocket templates in the sheet and heat sealing it back onto itself using a heatpress  <p>Once that was finished and fully cooled, we could begin inflating each pocket and testing out our newly made packaging material.  </p> <p>After the first few tests we discovered a few leaks in the material where we hadn\u2019t sealed it properly. to melt these back down we used the edge of a hot pan, this works wonders for applying directional heat and can be done very easily and quickly. </p> <p>After that, we tested again and success! </p> <p>Each of the pockets was able to inflate without bursting. </p> <p>Key Learning: We discovered that it\u2019s easier to seal off the air entryway completely, with a few strips of gelatine, creating a completely sealed environment. Then inflate each pocket by inserting a needle connected to a small length of tubing into the air pocket and inflating it. This creates a much smaller hole for the air to escape out of and can be sealed up quickly without losing any of the air inside the pocket. </p> <p>Once each pocket is successfully inflated, (you can either use a small pump like we did, or blow down the tube, both ways will work just as well as each other) you can wrap it around whatever object you\u2019d like that fits and know that it will be decently protected in case it\u2019s dropped during transit. </p>  Testing out how we might be able to seal the gelatin material"},{"location":"Term%202/03.%20Digital%20Prototyping%20for%20Design.html#how-we-felt","title":"How we felt:","text":"<p>At first we weren\u2019t all that confident that we\u2019d get the gelatine material to inflate at all as we hadn\u2019t managed to achieve a uniform consistency, with some parts of the sheet being much thicker than the other.

This creates a unique identifying token that is is always and forever spread amongst the blockchain, allowing them to always prove they were the first one to publish that work.  Minting that creative work also allows the creator(s) to be fairly compensated for their work through the use of smart contracts that ensure strict adherence to whichever distribution model you has the creator have chosen to publish under that anytime someone accesses a repository, a piece of software, an image etc. they have to abide by. Each time your creative work is purchased or downloaded, it gets logged on the blockchain network, ensuring a clear and transparent history of where your creative work has been used. The network also allows Patreon like features, where users can access exclusive unlockable content once an NFT associated with your project has been purchased.</p> <p>Importing content to host on DAFNE+ will create a link between the content and the blockchain network itself. Access to content can then be shared amongst members in a team.</p> <p>Content that has been uploaded to the DAFNE+ platform, can then be later minted as NFTs through the NFT marketplace.</p>  \ud83d\udca1 **Important to Note:** Publishing an NFT on the DAFNE+ network will incur a fee from the blockchain network it runs on. This cost is known as \u201cGas\u201d a common necessity to allow the network to be maintained and run. Typically associated with the Ethereum Network.   <p>I think the idea behind the Dafne+ platform is a really cool way of approaching the idea of intellectual property protection,  I think it\u2019s something that could make a real step in opening up and speeding up the pace of innovation. </p> <p>I think it could allow people to more freedom to discuss ongoing project work as opposed to the current model, where everything is hidden under NDA just in case ideas get stolen and protected first.  Whereas this distribution model, by logging and showing unequivocally that you were the first to develop this idea, it might potentially allow you to prove in court that you were indeed first if you feel that somebody has copied or stolen your ideas. </p> <p>If it ends up getting off the ground and popularised by creatives as a viable alternative to distribution, I think it could make a phenomenal addition to IP law and protection. I hope that it works just as well for protecting projects developed to be open source,  as I think these types of projects are incredibly important and make technology and design much more accessible.</p> <p>Check out the Dafne+ Platform here</p>"},{"location":"Term%202/04.%20Fair%20Futures.html#collaborative-project-fascination-life-under-the-regime","title":"Collaborative Project - \u201cFascination\u201d Life under the regime","text":"<p>We worked in groups to use the knowledge we\u2019d gained throughout the week to address one of the many issues we face in the state of climate crisis that we exist in and to tried to create a product or service that uses some of these technologies to try and address this issue. </p> <p>Identifying the problem and potential solution</p> <p>The problem my group and I wanted to focus on was trying to combat the resurgence of fascism in the world (not the easiest thing I know, but a fun thought experiment nonetheless \ud83d\ude03). </p> <p>After a lot of discussion amongst our group, trying to figure out how we could build a product or service that could work towards this goal and be hosted on the Dafne+ platform, we landed on the concept of creating a VR video game as an educational tool. </p> <p>How it works</p> <p>People playing the game would find themselves dropped in an alternative present of a well known city run by a fascist regime.

Together, we built a mini fablab in our classroom, fostering collaboration and creativity. The program focuses on exploring complex concepts related to emerging futures, making it an exciting journey of learning and self-discovery.  <p>03/10/23 - First day and intro lecture: </p> <p>On our first day of proper class (after the faff of registration), we were welcomed by Guillem and Tomas (two of the programme directors) and introduced to all the faculty members who will be supporting us throughout the course. They what we would be focusing on this semester and in the beginning the amount of work ahead of us seemed overwhelming and for a moment I thought \u201cshit, have I bitten off more than I can chew here?\u201d however, we were reminded that we are not designing alone and that we have the support of our peers, we are all in the same boat and our diverse backgrounds, ranging from politics, environmental conservation, business, and design is precisely what will see us through the programme, as everyone has a wealth of expertise and experience to offer that will always lend a new perspective or angle.  </p> <p>We also met Laura, the third director of the program, who has a PhD in Philosophy. Although some of her concepts went over my head, I am excited to learn more. We took part in an exercise where we brought an item that held personal meaning to us and placed it in the context of epistemic knowledge theories. This exercise aimed to encourage vulnerability and sharing among the group. I shared my backpack, which symbolizes adventure, knowledge, and reminds me of my partner, who gave it to me. </p> <p>Throughout the lecture, I found myself trying to plan my interventions and visualize the work to be done, but I realized that it was distracting me from being present in the moment.

The range of projects was inspiring, from sustainable hydrogen production to noise reduction smart citizen kits. The Fablab and Fabcity projects stood out for their innovative approach to rapid prototyping and design for the majority. After the lectures, we had a tour of Poblenou led by Chiara, one of our faculty members. We visited various projects and foundations in the area, including Biciclot, Bioma, Transfolabs, and Gallery.</p> <p>05/10/2023 - Documenting Design intro, building with Gitlab and Classroom rearranging with mini fablab</p> <p>The day began with a class on documenting design taught by Pablo Zuolaga, a former MDEF alumni. Pablo emphasized the importance of keeping a comprehensive log of our projects and creative work. He shared examples of how documenting his process opened new opportunities for him. Pablo highlighted the use of pictures and videos to make documentation engaging and provided insights on storytelling through project documentation. We were encouraged to keep a log of our daily activities as a way to track our thoughts, feelings, and processes. </p> <p>Later, Josep Marti taught us how to create a personal portfolio website using Github and Gitbash. Although I struggled with the setup, I found the idea of coding my own website exciting and empowering (though as of the time of this writing I have only just got my head round how to code this bloody site properly \u2014thanks to ChatGPT).

We really leaned into the idea at first and as we began exploring into what we could make we decided to see what else we could come up with. A bunch of ideas were tossed around, from a party in a box that would spray glitter everywhere once you opened the microwave door to a multicoloured dome that would rotate around the light in the microwave for different moods. Eventually we settled on the idea of creating an \u201canti microwave\u201d that would actively cool your food from above via the cooling fan as you attempted to eat it from the spinning plate below. The whole thing would be supported on a frame that you would have to reach around and make it difficult to eat. </p> <p>The idea behind it was to create a feeling frustration while eating, frustration at the difficulty of getting at the food and frustration at the fact that your food was actively being cooled while you ate. In a round about way we are trying to create something that allows you to empathise with people who may struggle to eat in a normal way, so it takes them much longer to do so, meaning the food gets cold and unpleasant to eat.  </p> <p>We mocked up a quick idea of how it could work, tested out how we would attach some of our components to the whole system and then presented it to the class for feedback and evaluation from the group. After which we sat down and tried to make a quick plan for how next week is going to go down, when we are going to build everything, film everything (oh yeah, we also have to shoot a 1 minute film for the product to show how it works \u2014 that\u2019s going to be great fun we have some cracking ideas for that) and how we are going to split our time within the group based on our strengths. </p> <p></p> <p>I\u2019m looking forward to it, we are going to have a great time.

We split ourselves in our groups to focus on different tasks to get the machine built and assembled on time. From coding to laser cutting, soldering, rewiring and repurposing we all got involved to bring our idea to a reality. All of us had different skill sets, with some coming from more hands on, build stuff and break stuff design backgrounds (definitely me) and others having a more logistical and organisational background. We managed to collaborate and play off our skills to work together and build something really fun. </p> <p>When we first presented the concept for our idea, we wanted to create something that mimicked the struggle to eat, but as we developed the concept of a reverse microwave, we discovered that our concept wouldn\u2019t allow us to get to exactly what we wanted, so we adapted. After discovering that we couldn\u2019t give our AC components any more of a brain with Arduino than just turning it on or off for a period of time, we decided to run two separate circuits. The normal AC one that powered the cooling fan and the plate motor, and a separate DC circuit that would allow us to control a lighting and sound system, designed to illuminate the food with a cool blue light and play a really annoying high pitched sound that would only start when the food was placed down on the rotating plate. </p> <p>Because you obviously have to have a sound that plays to alert you that your food is being cooled down no? </p> <p>We scavenged some more parts from our original microwave chassis, specifically the bottom panel of the casing that supported a rotating ring that allowed the plate to spin, so that we didn\u2019t have to make a new one, as well as switch to activate the whole system when weight was added to the plate. These pieces, some laser cut pieces of plywood, a borrowed frame from the Fablab and some 3d printed parts came together to create our final contraption. </p> adjusting the frame size"},{"location":"term1/04-The%20Machine%20Paradox.html#the-anxious-air-cooling-machine-a-machine-to-cool-your-food-when-the-microwave-is-just-too-hot","title":"The Anxious Air cooling machine \u2014 a machine to cool your food when the microwave is just too hot!","text":""},{"location":"term1/04-The%20Machine%20Paradox.html#take-a-look-at-our-final-creation-and-the-process-presentation-here","title":"Take a look at our final creation and the process presentation here!","text":"<p>After some touch and go moments where suddenly different components weren\u2019t working properly or when we discovered that we\u2019d stuck the fan in backwards by accident, we managed to put it together in a way that didn\u2019t even look half bad! and it survived all the tests we put it through. </p> <p>We presented our final machine to the rest of the class and faculty on Friday, sharing with everyone what we had finally managed to put together over the past fast and messy two weeks.

Acting as an exercise in building for an unknown objective. We were presented with a list the 16 basic human desires (as determined by researchers from the dark arts of motivational psychology \u2014 about which you can read more here) from which we were to pick one that either we resonated with or disagreed with, and then build a machine that would work towards or against that desire. These machines didn\u2019t have to necessarily work (as all we had with us were rough recycled materials) but were more there to represent an idea \u2014 hence the term magic machines. </p> <p>These machines were then going to become companions in our lives for the rest of the week, to see for ourselves how we would interact with them on a day to day basis, and whether or not they succeeded in making us feel the way we wanted them too.</p> <p>Emotional Balance</p> <p>Out of the 16 basic human desires, I chose Tranquillity. Something that resonated quite deeply with me and was something that I wanted to explore a bit further \u2014 how can I create something that either represents or enhances tranquillity in my own day to day life?  </p> <p>With that in mind, I ended up with making a simple set of scales (albeit not very good ones now in hindsight) out of two aluminium cans, some scrap wood, the bottom of an egg carton and some twine. One side representing positive emotions and the other negative ones. </p> <p>As you went about your day you would place a marble in either the positive or negative can and over time you\u2019d be able to notice if an imbalance in your emotional state was starting to take place, with a visual reminder acting as soft cue to try and restore some balance by encouraging you to stop and reflect for a moment.  </p> <p>Why?</p> <p>when trying to come up with my machine, I ended up thinking about how much of what is happening in the world can feel very negative, throwing us off balance and being immersed in so many negative emotions (whether we notice them or not) can make life a very difficult place to be, and sometimes a visual reminder to find your equilibrium is just what\u2019s needed.</p> <p>Because It\u2019s easy to slip into extremes when that\u2019s all that you see around you, and having a visual indicator of the emotions surrounding you can be a reminder to go and do something that makes you genuinely happy and brings you some joy (whatever that may be) can help you bring some balance back to your life.

From there we had to commit to a 24 hour challenge of living within that idea and document our experience on it. </p> <p>I\u2019m really interested in designing for a sustainable future guided by long termism and regenerative and circular design principles. I\u2019d come across the concept of the 2000 watt society, which is an idea posed by some researchers in Zurich that suggests limiting the average individual energy consumption to 2000 watts to achieve a sustainable society, while ensuring that there is no perceived loss in quality of life through an emphasis on energy efficiency, renewable energy sources, and lifestyle changes to reduce overall energy consumption. You can read more about that here. </p> <p>This seemed like a really interesting idea, so I wanted to explore how I could live those changes in my own life and note down what problems (if any) that I encountered. </p> <p>How and Why</p> <p>I decided to split my 24 hours into two halves, the first 12 hours I would change nothing, and simply note down everything that I used that consumed electricity, how long I used it for and using a simple formula, calculate how much power I\u2019d consumed using each machine. After adding it all up together, see if I was over the usage limit and then adjust my habits for the next 12 hours to see if I could stay under the limit and see how it affected me. </p> <p>The formula: Energy Consumption (Wh)=(\u2211Power Rating of Device (W)\u00d7Duration of Use (h)) </p> <p>It turned out that on that particular day when I summed everything up (probably not everything I used but a close guestimate) I was over the limit by 1440 watts as my fridge ate up all the power allocation for the day immediately at 2000 watts of power just on its own over the course of a day of using it, but without it I was actually actually under the 2000 watt usage limit, coming in at a solid 1440 watts! So, knowing full well that for this experiment I couldn\u2019t just \u201cuse the fridge less, or unplug it\u201d I wanted to make it even more of a challenge and see if I could stay under a 1000 watts of energy usage for the day. </p> <p>This meant doing a quick bit of maths to try and see where I could get some energy reduction without it impacting my life in a way that would normally make me want to stop doing it or affect me being able to go about my day of classes. With a bit of tweaking to laptop charger usage times, coffee machine, television and public transport usage I was able to contain my consumption to under 1000 watts. </p> <p></p> planning and outcome of the challenge <p> </p> <p>Lifestyle Changes</p> <p>I had to reduce the amount of public transport I took, which just encouraged more walking, and honestly, it really didn\u2019t affect my life much at all, it was quite fun trying to get into the nitty gritty of working around these limits. </p> <p>Involving yourself</p> <p>Now that being said, if I was going to continue doing this living under 2000 watts challenge, I would definitely need to get far pickier with all my appliances, starting with the fridge, and I can already see that from the amount of work I had to put in just at the beginning to document everything (which was a bit of a pain) most people probably wouldn\u2019t do it (heck I probably wouldn\u2019t either). But that\u2019s great though, as it now creates some really interesting paths to explore, to ask questions like: </p> <p>What if all our devices had a little display on them that showed you their power usage constantly so you could keep track? </p> <p>Could you use internet of things to create an ecosystem where products talk to each other and cycle their power systems autonomously so that other devices in the network can draw the energy that they need? </p> <p>and many many more. </p> <p>These are questions that I wouldn\u2019t have discovered really if I had just been looking the concept from the outside, sure I might have ended up going down the same line of inquiry at some point after much theoretical explanation, but really living it, even for such a short time, was enough to immediately highlight some of the challenges and areas of opportunity that can develop into new and exciting \u201cHow might we\u201d questions and routes of investigation. </p> <p>final Thoughts</p> <p>First person perspective is definitely a useful tool in the designers toolkit, and when applied correctly can lead to some really valuable insights at the beginning of a design project. It\u2019s something that I will for sure use in future projects and creative work, and documenting the entire experience through video or journals and audio logs, is an incredibly useful way of keeping track of what you are experiencing and can help lead to new insights later on when combined with other forms of research and user testing that come with designing any sort of solution. </p> <p>New possibilities for collaboration</p> <p>Finally, being able to see the work of my classmates, their explorations into different subject matters was an incredible experience and opportunity to get to know them on a much more creative level, with areas of research from maximising learning in VR to adapting to a world of surveillance capitalism, they all presented really cool opportunities for collaboration and I\u2019m excited to work together with them in areas that I have no knowledge in whatsoever, and see what kind of cool shit we can come up.</p>"},{"location":"term1/06-Design%20Studio%2002%20-%20Our%20first%20Intervention.html","title":"Design Studio 01.01 - Our first intervention","text":""},{"location":"term1/06-Design%20Studio%2002%20-%20Our%20first%20Intervention.html#intro","title":"Intro","text":"<p>Our second design studio class was led by Jana and Roger.

I was interested (and still am to this day) in exploring how we can change the value proposition around traditional waste material. How can we design products and services that are easy to repair so they aren\u2019t seen as waste, or how can we reuse waste from food industries to create new biomaterials for products?</p> <p>I joined forces with some of my classmates, Carmen, Carlotta and Minhea. We all shared an interest in reframing waste as a valuable material supply, from recycling concrete to creating biomaterials and changing policy.</p> <p>We then sat down to create a shared digital design space for our particular group interests to see if we could all find something to work together on.</p> <p>This was a valuable way for us to get all our ideas out on paper. It encouraged us to have conversations around what we actually considered to be waste ourselves, what our different ideas were around how we should go about preventing waste or recovering value from it, and how we wanted to explore it ourselves.</p> <p>Initially, we struggled to come up with an idea as to what kind of intervention we could make in the time that we had, as waste is such a colossal topic! But Roger reminded us that an intervention doesn\u2019t have to be the \u201cbe all end all\u201d solution; it doesn\u2019t even have to be a solution; it can be a stepping stone in part of your design research that helps lead to deeper and more interesting questions that provide the insight you need to get the real solution at the end of the tunnel. After that, we settled on trying to aim for a more reflective approach, where we would create some form of activity that we could do with members of the public to get their perceptions around waste and how we could try and change their view on it.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"term1/06-Design%20Studio%2002%20-%20Our%20first%20Intervention.html#our-first-design-intervention","title":"Our first design intervention","text":"<p>This intervention ended up completely different from what we had initially thought we wanted to do. We always had the aim of making a reflective activity that people could take part in that would challenge their ideas around what waste would be, but the path we travelled to get there was completely different to what I thought we would do.</p> <p>Our first plan was to host a workshop where participants could make their own biomaterial from household organic waste products and turn it into something useful. And to do that, we had to test out if it was even possible to create any sort of useful material in your kitchen.</p> <p></p> <p>So we got together one crisp Saturday morning to do just that, meeting in the biolab in the IAAC building to cook up a variety of materials based on recipes we found from Materiom (one of my favourite resources; learn more about them here) along with a few other sources.</p> <p>During this exploration, while we were cooking and discussing, we realised that this topic was far too broad and not something that could easily be condensed into a 1-hour workshop and that this process was going to far too long and not create the kind of impact we were looking for.</p> <p>So we pivoted.</p> <p>We returned to the drawing board and tried to come up with something new. After some time, we came across the work done by a group here in Barcelona called Domestic Data Streamers. They hosted all sorts of exhibitions with data gathered from people in entertaining and interactive ways that created the kind of reflection we wanted. So we tried our hand at this; we decided to make some interactive questions and host informal Q&amp;A sessions with the people living here in Barcelona.</p> <p>Starting with a primary survey we sent out, we wanted to get a rough feel for what people thought about some basic questions around waste and value. Asking things like what would you consider waste? And how have you repurposed your waste, if at all? And many more; you can take a look at the original survey here.</p> <p>Asking these questions helped us to look for the deeper questions in the answers we received. From these answers, we landed on 3 key questions we wanted to know the answer to:</p> <ul> <li>what they considered to be waste</li> <li>what they wanted to change themselves</li> <li>What was holding them back from making a change?</li> </ul> <p>These questions would be answered with a sticker represneting one of two statements, so we were actually getting an answer to two questions in one!</p> <p></p> <p>With these questions in mind, we created our interactive posters, stuck them to some large pieces of cardboard we found (very low-tech, I know) and proceeded with our intervention. We hung a set of posters up in our own university building to see what the reactions and responses would be from people who we thought would be the most likely to be aware of and working towards solutions around these issues and the next, we took around Barcelona with us!</p> <p>We wandered around the neighbourhood of Gracia, inviting strangers to participate in our research and see what they had to say. While this was initially a little nerve-racking, we got over it, and soon, we were chatting with people left and right and getting some fantastic insights. I\u2019m glad we took this approach; the answers we got and our conversations really painted an interesting picture that we wouldn\u2019t have gotten otherwise if we\u2019d done something else. Turns out most people are trying their hardest to repurpose the majority of their plastic waste into other useful things around their home and life, as well as turning as much food waste as they can into compost for their plants!</p> <p></p> <p>That was definitely different from what I was expecting.</p> <p>Overall, it was a fascinating data-gathering exercise. I\u2019m happy now that I think I have a better understanding of what a design intervention is and how it can be used to begin to create the alternative presents we want to achieve.

I decided to focus on using the unique properties of sunflowers(Helianthus annuus L.) that enable them to clean up pollutants such as heavy metals from the soil they grow in, a process known as phytoremediation and splicing in a series of genes taken from mangrove trees (Rhizophoraceae) that allows them to thrive in much harsher and saltier conditions that would be deadly to most other plant life found on land. Creating a new sunflower hybrid that could be planted in areas of land considered too polluted, degraded or marshy for other types of life. Cleaning up the surrounding soil by removing contaminants and leaving healthier, cleaner soils behind. </p> <p>Sunflowers are one of the most widely used plants for phytoremediation, as they can accumulate various metals and organic compounds from the soil, such as cadmium, lead, arsenic, and uranium. Sunflowers also have high biomass production, fast growth rate, and high seed yield, making them economically valuable and easy to cultivate. However, sunflowers are sensitive to salt stress, which limits their application in saltwater-contaminated soils.</p> <p></p> <p>Mangrove trees are a group of tropical and subtropical plants that grow in intertidal zones along the coastlines. Mangrove trees have evolved remarkable adaptations to cope with high salinity, low oxygen, and variable water levels in their natural habitats. For example, they have salt glands that excrete excess salt from their leaves, pneumatophores that facilitate gas exchange in waterlogged soils, and viviparous seeds that germinate while still attached to the parent plant. However, mangrove trees are not known to have phytoremediation potential, and their slow growth rate and low seed dispersal make them difficult to propagate and establish.</p> <p>By combining the genes from mangrove trees and sunflowers, I\u2019ve tried to create a hybrid plant that has the best of both worlds: the stress tolerance of mangroves and the phytoremediation potential of sunflowers. </p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>The project proposes to create a new plant that can improve the quality of polluted or contaminated soils and restore the natural balance of the environment using genetic engineering techniques to transfer genes from mangrove trees into a common sunflower variety. </p> <p>The candidate genes identified from mangrove trees and sunflowers are involved in stress tolerance, pollutant transport, and gas exchange. These are some of the genes we are going to use:</p> <ul> <li>For stress tolerance, we are going to use the genes encoding P-type ATPase transporters (HAKT1 and HAKT2) and ATP-binding cassette transporters (HABC1 and HABC2). These genes are involved in the vacuole sequestration of sodium ions and the maintenance of cellular homeostasis. These genes are found in mangrove species and confer high salt tolerance and drought resistance levels.</li> <li> <p>For pollutant transport, we are going to use the genes encoding metal tolerance proteins (MTP1 and MTP2) known as heavy metal associated transporters (HMATs). These genes are involved in metal detoxification and sequestration in plants. These genes are also found in sunflower species, and they have high substrate specificities or affinities for different metals, such as cadmium, zinc, copper, and lead.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Relevant HMATs</p> <ul> <li>HM-associated isoprenylated plant protein (HIPP) family,</li> <li>HM-associated protein (HMP) family, ferric chelate reductase (FRO) family,</li> <li>an expansion gene (EXPA) family,</li> <li>L-Cys desulfhydrase (LCD) family,</li> <li>metallothionein (MT) family,</li> <li>nicotianamine synthase (NAS) family,</li> <li>ubiquitin (Ub)-extension protein (UBQ) family</li> </ul> <p></p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>For gas exchange, we are going to use the genes encoding photosynthetic and respiratory enzymes, such as Rubisco (RBCS and RBCA), plastocyanin (PCY1 and PCY2), cytochrome c oxidase (COX1 and COX2), and laccase (LAC1 and LAC2). These genes are involved in carbon fixation, electron transport, oxygen consumption, and lignification. These genes are also found in mangrove species, and they enhance the gas exchange efficiency and the carbon sequestration capacity of the plant.</p> </li> </ul> <p>To make these changes, we will use CRISPR-Cas9, a gene editing innovation that uses site-directed nucleases to target and modify DNA with great accuracy. We can design different guide RNAs (gRNAs) that recognise and bind to specific DNA sequences in the sunflower genome and use a Cas9 protein that cuts the DNA at the target site and allows us to introduce mutations, deletions, or insertions of DNA fragments. To transfer these genes into the sunflower cells, we can use plasmid vectors and Agrobacterium tumefaciens to transfer the gRNAs and the Cas9 protein directly into the sunflower cells.</p> <p>To ensure the success of the new plant, we will comprehensively evaluate the performance and impact of the hybrid under diverse environmental conditions. We\u2019ll assess its growth and survival in various soil types, including sandy, clayey, loamy, and peaty soils, comparing it against non-modified sunflower plants. Additionally, we\u2019ll measure pollutant uptake, examining its ability to absorb metals, organic compounds, radioactive substances, and oil. Moreover, we\u2019ll test its resilience under different salinity levels, ranging from 0 to 500 mM NaCl, evaluating growth, survival, and pollutant uptake efficiency in these varying saline conditions. This multifaceted analysis aims to understand the hybrid\u2019s adaptability and effectiveness in remediating different types of soil pollution.</p> <p>I believe the proposal is creative and feasible. I hope this hybrid plant will grow in saltwater-contaminated soils and remove harmful substances from the environment while also providing other benefits such as biomass production, seed yield, and ecosystem restoration.</p> <p>However, it\u2019s important to acknowledge that the proposal has some limitations and challenges. We need to consider the ethical, social, and ecological implications of creating and releasing a genetically modified organism into the environment and the need to ensure the safety and stability of the hybrid plant and prevent any unwanted effects or interactions with other organisms. </p> <p>Overall, I think this has been a really interesting introduction into the world of designing with biology, a great way to reframe the way we look at how we can create in the world,  do all our solutions to the problems we find in the world have to be made by a machine in a factory? Perhaps not. Maybe we can start to see biology as our next big design partner and grow and modify the nature that surrounds us to solve problems that we otherwise couldn\u2019t have solved. \ud83d\ude03</p>"},{"location":"term1/09-Bio%20Zero.html#bibliography","title":"Bibliography","text":"<p>Dimitrijevic, A. and Horn, R.

Kicking off with a visit to the CCCB Museum, where we explored an exhibition on the development of AI, from its conceptual inception from researchers like Alan Turing to the incredible capabilities of modern generative AI systems. We delved into the implications of AI in our lives, pondering questions like when an AI could be considered \u201calive\u201d and the ethical dilemmas surrounding AI in weaponry.</p> <p>In class, we dissected the workings of AI systems and how they are built.

I think we\u2019re the first generation (And I don\u2019t mean generation in the sense of like a 10 - 15 year gap), of people that have really sort of embraced AI fully. Ever since the launch of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT last year. I think that\u2019s why we\u2019re all so interested in it, because we\u2019ve all been using these AI tools much more visibly and in some cases (like mine) almost daily. </p> <p>We\u2019ve seen what they can do and we\u2019ve been exposed to how they can create these incredible, incredible things, helping us with so many tasks that before took us much much longer. </p> <p>The I think that this entire week has been really interesting because we not only had to learn about developing these AI systems, we learned about how they\u2019re built and what they\u2019re trained on. But in particular they put a lot of emphasis on the bias that can happen in these models based on the training data and how important it is to have incredibly varied training data to overcome this, but it\u2019s getting that varied training data that can be really difficult, and an AI model is only as good as the data its trained on. </p> <p>An AI model is only as good as the data it\u2019s trained on. </p> <p>One of the key things that I\u2019m taking away from this module is that this is another transition in our world and we\u2019ve opened the box. AI is out there, and we\u2019re using it all the time, but it feels as though we haven\u2019t given the proper attention and thought as to how these models are actually working: </p> <ul> <li>what data sets are they built on?</li> <li>Is this reinforcing biases we already have?</li> </ul> <p>Or more importantly, is our increasing reliance on these tools to parse and interpret all the information in the world around us beginning to make us overly reliant on them? </p> <p>This question even came up when we were building Green Guardian. Would you end up just relying on the AI for diagnosis or would you still go and check somewhere else? I think that there\u2019s a real risk that we just become overly reliant on these models, as they make it so easy to offload a lot of the grunt work of thinking.  </p> <p>At the moment all AI\u2019s (at least to my knowledge but I would love to learn I\u2019m wrong) still suffer from machine hallucinations \u2014this is where they just make stuff up \u2014 that could lead to some misdiagnoses and completely ruined crops if a more advanced system like Green Guardian was used on a large scale.</p> <p>The best part of this module was how easy it made to it to understand the basics and some of the nuances of AI research in the quest for machine intelligence.  It gave me a new appreciation for coding, especially coding Python. It always seemed like a scary foreign language, but now I understand it a bit more, I understand it\u2019s utility and it gives you this real window into how these systems work and the language that makes them tick. </p> <p>AI is a new, fantastic and amazing tool, it has the potential to do a phenomenal amount of good in the world, pushing us into exciting new futures that benefit everyone, but if we don\u2019t put the safeguards in now and understand that if we\u2019re going to create and use these models, we need to make sure that the training data we give it is as diverse and different as possible, that whatever data we train them on is fairly compensated to the original creators of that information and that we strive to develop these systems as ethically as possible. </p> <p>Finally there\u2019s one last question that\u2019s been playing on my mind since finishing this module, the large language models we\u2019ve gotten so used to using require an incredible amount of energy, not only to train them in the beginning but also to maintain the cooling necessary to keep the servers they operate on happy and healthy.</p> <p>So I\u2019m left wondering, what exactly is the environmental impact of these models that are so widespread now?

After this we fell into various pockets of discussion around what we had found interesting, what we had discovered over the course of our first group and individual interventions and what directions this made us want to go into now. </p> <p>I joined this masters wanting to explore all sorts of strange and wonderful new areas of exploration that I wouldn\u2019t normally be able to explore so I decided to try and explore an area that I\u2019ve always found interesting but is vastly different from what I\u2019m normally trained in, the field of interfacing technology with nature and moving towards organic computing. I ended up collaborating with my classmates Nicolo, Marius, Everardo, Jorge, and Albert, as we had all expressed an interest in this field.</p> <p>We had no set roles throughout this project so far, as none of us had any prior knowledge on plant signalling, except Albert I suppose, who is an ecologist. Some of us had more experience with Arduino and coding so they took on those roles, but overall we all worked to help each other out.</p> <p>When we started, we began with combing the internet for anything and everything we could find based on this topic (we found some cool stuff, I\u2019ll link it at the bottom of this article) from computing research using mushrooms to making music with the electrical signals within plants. With one of the most interesting projects we\u2019d come across demonstrating that you could use certain plants as analogue inputs and outputs. </p> <p>one of the most interesting projects we\u2019d come across demonstrating that you could use certain plants as analogue inputs and outputs. </p> <p>What this bizarre sentence means is that you can effectively connect two plants together, use one as an input, and the other as an output. Meaning you can send a message between two plants! (for more on this crazy subject check out the TED talk on this subject linked here)</p> <p>So it turns out that our little green friends are actually much more sensitive than we give them credit for and they are able to process much more information than we can see. </p> <p>After discussing what we had found out together and mapping out each of our interests in a collaborative Miro board, we decided on a direction. </p> <p></p>  Our early Miro board mapping  <p>We were going to try and receive, interpret and then eventually try and decode the electrical and chemical signals plants use to transmit information within themselves.</p> <p>Imagine what we could learn if we really understood our ecology? </p> <p>Luckily for us, some of these projects were open source and had freely shared everything they had learned on GitHub (bless the open source community). From these learnings we collected what we would need, a bunch of Arduino heart rate ECG monitors and the Arduino boards to control the whole system. </p> <p>Easy right? </p> <p>Not so much, first we tested the ECG sensors on ourselves and no dice. No matter how much we tried and what we changed, we just couldn\u2019t get the contact pads to read the electrical signals produced by our own hearts (which is how these sensors work) let alone read the the much lower frequency signals created by the plants we were studying. </p> <p></p>  A first test using the ECG monitors on ourselves  <p>We eventually managed to read some sort of electrical spikes within an Orchid that we were studying and our excitement was over the moon! Though that excitement was shot down pretty quickly when we weren\u2019t able to decipher if what we were reading was actual changes in electrical activity based on stimulus we were giving the plant or if it was just electrical noise and interference within the circuit itself. </p> <p>So back to square one. Shit.</p> <p>After a lot of work and research, we came across a project that had been using the same technology we were using to turn the electrical signals of plants into music using a MIDI synthesiser, lucky for us this project had been put up on GitHub (find out more here) and we were able to reverse engineer the code they used. Reverse engineering this code, along with getting the ECG sensors to work properly while also calibrating them was probably the most challenging part of the process at this point in the project. From this we were able to build a custom circuit configuration using our Arduinos and ECGs to finally be able to read the signals properly. </p> <p>Then came the moment of truth\u2026</p> <p>We connected our trusty plant friend up to the ECG pads and plugged the other end into the circuit, a few moments passed as the system booted and looked for something in the ether. We held our breath for a moment as nothing seemed to be happening, hovering on the verge of failure once again when suddenly\u2026spikes of activity! </p> <p>SUCCESS! </p> <p>To our shocked surprise it actually worked! We were reading the real and actual electrical signals within the plant! To test our theory we gently touched one of the leaves of our plant and shouted with joy as we watched the electrical signals spike as we touched it\u2019s leaves. To make extra sure we then fed it a little bit of water and as the water started to sink into the roots of the plant, another series of spike in activity! </p> <p>We\u2019d linked the signal monitoring program to a piece of software called Touch Designer,  which allows you to visualise pretty much any data input, so now we have some glowing spheres that grow larger or smaller based on peaks or troughs in the electrical activity \u2014 which I have to say looks pretty cool. </p> <p>We\u2019ve made progress and covered new ground, granted we can now read the signals but can\u2019t actually interpret them, much like listening to someone speak Latin when you don\u2019t, you know they are are saying something but you\u2019ve got no idea what. </p> <p>But still, progress. </p>  Our first Successful Tests!"},{"location":"term1/13-Design%20Studio%2001.04%20Collective%20Design%20Intervention.html#so-what","title":"So What?","text":"<p>At this point reading through this article (and it is a long article) you might be thinking, well this is cool and all that but what\u2019s the point?  </p> <p>Why bother trying to read and interpret these signals at all? </p> <p>Now that\u2019s a fair question, and one I asked myself many times throughout the project so far. </p> <p>Really the point is further try and understand the nature that surrounds us and be able to better interpret the needs of the ecologies that we live in so that we can begin to provide for them in different much more niche ways that we maybe haven\u2019t had the chance to do before.
