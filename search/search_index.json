Pablo emphasized the importance of keeping a comprehensive log of our projects and creative work. He shared examples of how documenting his process opened new opportunities for him. Pablo highlighted the use of pictures and videos to make documentation engaging and provided insights on storytelling through project documentation. We were encouraged to keep a log of our daily activities as a way to track our thoughts, feelings, and processes. </p> <p>Later, Josep Marti taught us how to create a personal portfolio website using Github and Gitbash. Although I struggled with the setup, I found the idea of coding my own website exciting and empowering (though as of the time of this writing I have only just got my head round how to code this bloody site properly \u2014thanks to ChatGPT). Afterwards, we  spent time rearranging the classroom to better suit our needs then headed down to Fablab on the ground floor and as a group (definitely looked like too many cooks in the kitchen, though if you looked close enough you\u2019d actually see a well oiled machine of naive joy at work) we built a series of workbenches to create  a mini fablab in the classroom.

It seems like a constantly changing and developing masters which makes it really exciting.</li> <li>It seems like we really are on the cutting edge of design education here and pushing the boundaries of what\u2019s possible as much as possible!</li> <li>Faculty seem very keen on seeing us as equals and not students, and have even organised informal drinks for everyone to get to know each other.</li> <li>Excited to see the rest of the week and what it has in store, and curious to see what the first assignment will be - apparently building a personal blog website?</li> </ul> <p> </p> Objects of meaing lecture and exercise <p>04/10/23 - Faculty Research areas and Poblenou Tour</p> <ul> <li>started the day with two different lectures from two of the course directors, Guillem &amp; Tomas, where they told us about what projects they\u2019ve worked on, how they\u2019ve developed them and what their areas of research focus are now.<ul> <li>this was super interesting, because the projects were so varied and seemed to really be having an impact! Ranging from areas around sustainable hydrogen production in Bali to provide clean energy to fisherman, to noise reduction smart citizen kits using open source technologies that are still produced and sold today. Mentioned a lot of inspiring things that made me think I was definitely in the right place.</li> <li>The Fablab and Fabcity projects really seem to be pushing the boundaries of what\u2019s possible right now with rapid prototyping. It really seemed to be pushing towards design for the other 90% not just what we do a lot right now in the western world which is design for that one 10% that can afford well designed products and services.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Following that lecture, a tour of Poblenou:<ul> <li>Chiara (one of our faculty and the rock of the programme) took us on a tour around the area we are going to be living and met some of the supporting projects and foundations that exist in the neighbourhood.</li> <li>What follows is a list and description of the different people and enterprises we met:<ul> <li>Biciclot</li> <li>Bioma</li> <li>Transfolabs</li> <li>Gallery</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>05/10/2023 - Documenting Design intro, building with Gitlab and Classroom rearranging with mini fablab</p> <ul> <li>Day started with a morning class in documenting design (or the importance of it, it\u2019s benefits and how it will help throughout the course, our careers and our lives) taught by Pablo Zuolaga, former MDEF alumni from a few years ago. Pablo used to work as a creative lead for a marketing agency in Colombia, creating advertising campaigns for global brands around the world.</li> <li>taught us the importance of keeping a great log of everything we do throughout our various projects and creative work. Showing us examples from his own personal life where documenting this process and publishing is what opened new doors and opportunities that he had never even dreamed about or thought possible before!</li> <li>reminded us about how it can act as a great reminder and also a catalyst for creativity as you can look back on your old work, see and track your old thought processes, pick up where you left off from or notice was of thinking and doing that have now changed as you have gained new knowledge and ways of doing that maybe now mean that you are able to start up a project once again when before you had hit a roadblock and didn\u2019t know how to get any further.</li> <li>he stressed the importance of using pictures and videos to aid in this documentation, and gave a really great breakdown of how to tell a great story through your project documentation that makes it both interesting and engaging to read and follow along with! (hence all the pictures and videos, they do say 1000 words after all)</li> <li>showed us how this type of documentation was going to be assessed by him and other faculty to see how we were keeping on top of our work and our project research, which is a great way of engaging with all the student work when they can.</li> <li>Every week we are encoruaged to keep a log of everything that has happened on that day and turn that into a relfection or blog post or what ever you like, as a way to document everything and keep track of your thoughts, feelings and processes about the work that we are doing.<ul> <li>funnily enough, alot of the things Pablo mentioned, i\u2019d already learned studying my Bachelors in Product Design at Bounremouth University, particularly when it focused on the importance of documenting everything in reference to a portfolio of work, which I felt really happy about as I thought that I could definitely keep on top of this through what I already know.</li> <li>What excited me even more though, was knowing that now I\u2019m going to learn how to really tell a good story through all this documenting, something I was never really good at before, my previous portfolios and dsign documentation have always felt really linear, following the next logical step i.e Ideation, Development, Concept selection, Testing, Refining, Detail design then implemention. Never really including any sort of problem, troubles, triumphs and failures along the way, I\u2019ve recently started to try and do this on my own to my exisitng portfolio website and to rewrite, reframe and structure it to turn it into a narrative. So having someone like Pablo (with all his knowledge in creative story telling for advertising) there to reexamine, review and bounce ideas off to further develop this side of documentation makes me really happy and I think I\u2019m going to learn a lot from this.  Excited to see where this goes and how I can develop my writing further from this.</li> <li>In an effort to improve, i\u2019m going to try and keep my reflections brief but engaging, detgailing everything weve done and the research I am working on week by week in a blog post format that I want to start to share on other social media platforms and not just the website we are building so that it keeps me accoutnable but also hopefully engages a wider audience who might be interested in the work we do here on this masters!</li> </ul> </li> <li>Following Pablo\u2019s lesson we had a course from Josep Marti (our resident expert on all things coding and digital building) on how to create, set up and develop our own personal portfolio website using Github and Gitbash.</li> <li>this was super interesting and the idea of learning how to write it all and code it using python scripts through Git is a really cool thing that I want to get much better at over the coming weeks. Though I admit that I fell behind in this class quite quickly as I was still figuring out all the set up for it.</li> <li>this is an area I definitely still need to improve on, as coding is something I never really learned before and for ages never had any interest in doing so. Though now, it\u2019s been put in a different perspective and I can see how it can actually be used to create products and services that I would use every day, and being able to do it myself gives me a real sense of ownership over the work which is great!</li> <li>There is still far more to learn that I don\u2019t know but with the help from my amazing classmates and Josep I think we\u2019ll get there!</li> <li>It\u2019s a fantastic way of learning by doing ,instead of having to watch countless hours of video or lectures on the principles behind coding and then doing it later you do it right there in class and outside of it with a real goal in mind; to develop the website that is going to host pretty much all of the documentation of the work we are going to be doing this year (and coincidentally where all our work will be marked by the faculty \u2014 so it has to work) in one place. Making sure that we really learn it as fast as possible and create something that really works out in the real world instead of just small practice problems and solutions that never get used again after that. Brilliant stuff.</li> <li>After that, we spent some time rearranging the classroom into an orientation that made it more comfortable to work in and developed it into a space that we could really grow into and use to suit our needs for the year.</li> <li>We used the fablab on theg round floor of the IAAC building to create furniture and workbenches that we were going to need to prototype various things in our classroom \u2014basically turning it into a mini fablab of it\u2019s own!</li> <li>everyone worked together to achieve a common goal and it was a really great way to see how we were all going to work and interact with eachother which I really enjoyed!</li> </ul> <p> </p> <p> </p> building a mini fablab for the classroom <p>06/10/23 - Exploring Elisava Design School Campus and Faculty member Laura\u2019s Research background</p> <ul> <li>in the morning we toured around the Elisava campus (the other university we are part of and whose facilities we have access too \u2014 very cool stuff) received our welcome packs and intro lectures to how we can access and use the facilites and toured what they had on offer.<ul> <li>it\u2019s a lot of high tech stuff but also a lot more rules than at the Fablab \u2014 there are more people they need to take care of so it makes sense.</li> </ul> </li> <li>we had a lecture from Laura Benitez (the third director of our programme and a doctor in philosophy) on her research background and what areas she is focusing on now.</li> <li>A lot of really cool topics from Biohacking, to trans and post humanism, transfeminism and many more that went completely over my head. I think I\u2019m going to really enjoy what she has to teach us but it\u2019ll definitely take me some time to get to understand it all and really grasp the depth of her research and knowledge.<ul> <li>seems like her lectures will be focused on asking ourselves who and what we are, what is our fight/purpose/why, why we create the way we do and how does that develop who we are as we create for these emerging futures.</li> <li>A lot of introspection here I think, in the next few months of the course.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p> </p> Intro lecture to the Elisava graphics room"},{"location":"term1/02-Roles%20of%20Prototyping%20in%20First%20Person%20Person%20Perspectives/","title":"Roles of Prototyping in First Person Person Perspective (1PP) Research through Design","text":"<p>Created: October 9, 2023 10:23 AM</p>  TL;DR:    This article delves into the First Person Perspective (1PP) in design, which emphasizes active engagement in research and development, critical assessment of problem-solving efforts, and involvement of stakeholders and the environment.

By being deeply involved and understanding the root cause of the issue, designers ensure that they address the underlying problems rather than just surface-level manifestations.</p> <p>This approach also emphasizes the importance of involving stakeholders throughout the entire design project, ensuring that the final product is actually used by its intended audience. It encourages designers to consider not only human users but also non-human agency, such as plants and animals, and the impact of their designs on the wider ecosystem.</p> <p>Furthermore, First Person Perspective recognizes that products have a lifecycle and will eventually \u201cdie.\u201d Designers are encouraged to consider the impact of the product\u2019s end-of-life, including how, when, and where it will cease to exist and what happens to it afterwards.

First Person Perspective emphasizes the importance of gathering information and developing solutions in a way that is not extractive but rather involves stakeholders, the environment, and the community.

These connections, in the form of a mind map that can seem a little chaotic, helped me to see links that I couldn\u2019t see before, sprawling outwards from some central ideas and that let me work backwards from abstract macro scale concepts like long-termism down to something more concrete that I can research and work towards like creating new forms of bio-materials for additive manufacturing. </p> <p>I much prefer creating these sorts of diagrams and working from them as they let me keep track of lots of various ideas together in one that I can then draw connections with in a visual way, rather than keeping different ideas in separate lists.

In our case we chose an old microwave \u2014 which was great fun as this is something that most people never think of tearing down as they are such long lasting products, which made it even more interesting to find out why it didn\u2019t work. </p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>We started to tear down the microwave to get access to it\u2019s insides and began our analysis of the individual parts. Inside we found as expected, a magnetron (the microwave emitter) , a transformer that powered the magnetron and provided it with the high amounts of power it needed, various switches that activated the different functions of the microwave, two motors and a lightbulb. What surprised us (which in hindsight probably shouldn\u2019t have as it\u2019s quite old) was just how simple the insides of the microwave actually was. with most of the connectors being removable clips it showed us that this analogue machine (by which I mean it didn\u2019t have a digital computer acting as a brain behind it) was designed to have multiple components easily replaced as nothing was soldered directly to the board (except components making up the power supply). While it wasn\u2019t exactly easy to access some of the components (like the switches) it was nice to see that this product was indeed designed to be replaced if needed. The only thing that wasn\u2019t fully easily replaceable was the power cable, and only it was because it was directly soldered to the board. </p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>We started to combine our findings from the teardown into a \u201cforensic report\u201d where we began to detail exactly what we found out about our product, how the different pieces were manufactured, where they were made, how they fit together and just exactly what was wrong with it. </p> <p>So far this has been a really great exercise in reframing the way we understand the products we interface with and how we can repurpose and change the technologies around us to truly attempt to give them a second life.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"term1/04-The%20Machine%20Paradox/#day-2-18102023-fault-testing-forensics","title":"Day 2 (18/10/2023)  - Fault testing forensics","text":"<p>Today we began testing each of the microwave components to see what was working and what wasn\u2019t. Most of the microwave components rely on AC power instead of usual DC, with only a few small components requiring DC which made testing components easy and slightly dangerous at the same time as we tested the different AC components using a power cable connected to the mains, which would be soldered or attached with various crocodile clips to the components we were testing. </p> <p></p> <p>Through our testing we discovered that the fault lay with the microwave emitter or the transformer, as every other component would function as intended or turn on when power was supplied \u2014 our shouts of joy as the microwave light turned on for the first time as we powered it on were enough to show how much we were enjoying ourselves. </p> <p></p> <p>I was surprised to learn that the entire system of the microwave had been wired in series, which meant that if one component failed (even something as small as the light bulb) the entire system would shut down and stop working.

We were trying to give an analogue machine a digital brain. After some trial and error it worked! we are able to sideload some instructions onto our system that would allow the circuit to turn on and off on a 10 second timer. Connected via a relay, we are able to control exactly when and how the motors would turn on, the next task (which I assume is coming later in the week) is to figure out a way to separate both motors from each other, as right now, the induction motor we salvaged which was originally used to spin the cooling fan splits the high level of voltage coming from the AC power supply into a two separate streams, with the fan motor pulling the majority of the voltage and leaving 30V over to power the motor that originally span the plate inside the microwave. However, while this is really useful inside a microwave, it means that currently the plate motor can only spin when the fan motor is on. So in our quest to create an almost useful machine \u2014 in our case we\u2019ve been thinking of turning the microwave into a spinning disco light \u2014 we have to deal with a motor that will only work if the other is powered on and running, which might or might not turn out to be useful. Who knows, maybe our disco light will provide cooling air conditioning at the same time\u2026</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>In any case, this was a really great exercise in getting to know the intricacies of debugging old analogue components, hacking them to work with the digital interfaces we work with now to create something new, debugging again and repeat until finally we can breathe new life into old tech that would otherwise have gone to waste.

I\u2019m excited to see how this project will turn out and what exactly we will create!</p> <p>Finally we shared our forensic report we\u2019d written about our microwave with the class, explaining how we\u2019d torn down the machine to get into its inner workings, how we tested each component to find out what was wrong with it, how we\u2019d found out what each component was made from and where it came from and what we\u2019d learned from tearing it down and debugging it.

Then we we got down to coming up with ideas for what kind of almost useful machine we wanted to create from the components we\u2019d managed to salvage as well as parts we could salvage from some of the other groups (hence the need for the data sheets we\u2019d created so all the groups can see and share them amongst each other to get the parts they needed). </p> <p></p> <p>Originally we thought of creating some form of disco light where the entire body of the microwave would turn on the plate motor, we\u2019d drill loads more holes in the body to let the light out and have the fan provide cooling from within the box like some form of really terrible air conditioning. We really leaned into the idea at first and as we began exploring into what we could make we decided to see what else we could come up with. A bunch of ideas were tossed around, from a party in a box that would spray glitter everywhere once you opened the microwave door to a multicoloured dome that would rotate around the light in the microwave for different moods. Eventually we settled on the idea of creating an \u201canti microwave\u201d that would actively cool your food from above via the cooling fan as you attempted to eat it from the spinning plate below. The whole thing would be supported on a frame that you would have to reach around and make it difficult to eat. </p> <p>The idea behind it was to create a feeling frustration while eating, frustration at the difficulty of getting at the food and frustration at the fact that your food was actively being cooled while you ate. In a round about way we are trying to create something that allows you to empathise with people who may struggle to eat in a normal way, so it takes them much longer to do so, meaning the food gets cold and unpleasant to eat.  </p> <p>We mocked up a quick idea of how it could work, tested out how we would attach some of our components to the whole system and then presented it to the class for feedback and evaluation from the group. After which we sat down and tried to make a quick plan for how next week is going to go down, when we are going to build everything, film everything (oh yeah, we also have to shoot a 1 minute film for the product to show how it works \u2014 that\u2019s going to be great fun we have some cracking ideas for that) and how we are going to split our time within the group based on our strengths. </p> <p></p> <p>I\u2019m looking forward to it, we are going to have a great time.

We split ourselves in our groups to focus on different tasks to get the machine built and assembled on time. From coding to laser cutting, soldering, rewiring and repurposing we all got involved to bring our idea to a reality. All of us had different skill sets, with some coming from more hands on, build stuff and break stuff design backgrounds (definitely me) and others having a more logistical and organisational background. We managed to collaborate and play off our skills to work together and build something really fun. </p> <p>When we first presented the concept for our idea, we wanted to create something that mimicked the struggle to eat, but as we developed the concept of a reverse microwave, we discovered that our concept wouldn\u2019t allow us to get to exactly what we wanted, so we adapted. After discovering that we couldn\u2019t give our AC components any more of a brain with Arduino than just turning it on or off for a period of time, we decided to run two separate circuits. The normal AC one that powered the cooling fan and the plate motor, and a separate DC circuit that would allow us to control a lighting and sound system, designed to illuminate the food with a cool blue light and play a really annoying high pitched sound that would only start when the food was placed down on the rotating plate. </p> <p>Because you obviously have to have a sound that plays to alert you that your food is being cooled down no? </p> <p>We scavenged some more parts from our original microwave chassis, specifically the bottom panel of the casing that supported a rotating ring that allowed the plate to spin, so that we didn\u2019t have to make a new one, as well as switch to activate the whole system when weight was added to the plate.

How did it break? and how can it be fixed, but truly asking how to understand the lifecycle of the machine and can we create value from something that others just see as waste? </p> <p>That\u2019s what I think this module is really designed to do, to shape the way we think about technology, and how when one machine gives up the ghost, it can be saved, repurposed and upcycled into something new that once again has value and meaning, not just another piece of junk to throw on the ever growing landfill. </p> <p></p>"}]}
