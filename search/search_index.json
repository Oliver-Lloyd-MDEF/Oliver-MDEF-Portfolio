Although some of her concepts went over my head, I am excited to learn more. We took part in an exercise where we brought an item that held personal meaning to us and placed it in the context of epistemic knowledge theories. This exercise aimed to encourage vulnerability and sharing among the group.

The range of projects was inspiring, from sustainable hydrogen production to noise reduction smart citizen kits. The Fablab and Fabcity projects stood out for their innovative approach to rapid prototyping and design for the majority. After the lectures, we had a tour of Poblenou led by Chiara, one of our faculty members. We visited various projects and foundations in the area, including Biciclot, Bioma, Transfolabs, and Gallery.</p> <p>05/10/2023 - Documenting Design, building with Gitlab and building a mini fablab in our classroom.</p> <p>The day began with a class on documenting design taught by Pablo Zuolaga, a former MDEF alumni. Pablo emphasized the importance of keeping a comprehensive log of our projects and creative work. He shared examples of how documenting his process opened new opportunities for him. Pablo highlighted the use of pictures and videos to make documentation engaging and provided insights on storytelling through project documentation. We were encouraged to keep a log of our daily activities as a way to track our thoughts, feelings, and processes. </p> <p>Later, Josep Marti taught us how to create a personal portfolio website using Github and Gitbash. Although I struggled with the setup, I found the idea of coding my own website exciting and empowering (though as of the time of this writing I have only just got my head round how to code this bloody site properly \u2014thanks to ChatGPT). Afterwards, we  spent time rearranging the classroom to better suit our needs then headed down to Fablab on the ground floor and as a group (definitely looked like too many cooks in the kitchen, though if you looked close enough you\u2019d actually see a well oiled machine of naive joy at work) we built a series of workbenches to create  a mini fablab in the classroom.

This shift has significant implications for the planet\u2019s ecosystems.</li> <li>Connectivity of Human Populations: The interconnectedness of the global population, not just in terms of digital communication but also through supply chains and global commerce. This interconnectedness exacerbates the impacts of crises in one area on the entire global system. Illustrated by a video on the supply chain crisis.</li> </ol> <p>It is these factors, occurring simultaneously, that represent a unique challenge in human and planetary history. </p> <p>The idea of Polycrisis resonated with me deeply. It presents a wicked problem, not just as a singular environmental crisis but as a complex web of interconnected issues without a single root cause. A design problem that cannot be solved by individual groups working in silo to achieve a single solution and then moving on to the next, but by multiple groups of interconnected people working towards and sharing information to help facilitate the transition into a better future.</p> <p>As designers, we have to take a step back and see the bigger picture. We must approach solutions considering the many ways in which different crises interact and impact one another, and the solutions we do end up creating must consider the vast scale and complexity of these interconnected problems.</p> <p> </p> An example of how we can visualise the wicked problem that is the current polycrisis, taken from the Global Risk report 2023 published by the World Economic Forum."},{"location":"Term%202/01.%20Designing%20in%20a%20State%20of%20Climate%20Emergency.html#time-and-perception","title":"Time and Perception","text":"<p>The \u201cLong Now\u201d, is a method of stretching the concept of now to the next 2,000 years and the past 2000 years, asking ourselves how are we being influenced by the past and what impact are we going to have on the future with the actions we take right now - A more long-term view </p> <p>Gustavo\u2019s lecture introduced an angle that I hadn\u2019t really considered before when it comes to design - our perception of time and its cultural interpretations. He explored how various cultures perceive time and its influence on actions and decisions. The most striking concept was \u2018positional temporality,\u2019 a notion that encourages viewing time not as a linear progression but as a 3D torus, where past, present, and future coexist and influence each other, particularly as they all return to the present moment. </p> <p>This concept encourages us all to (and this is something I wholeheartedly agree with) make design decisions that embrace a much longer timeline when considering the impact of the objects, services or policies that we create.

The melting point of Gelatine is about 35 degrees Celsius, and anything hotter than that will cut right through it. </p>  Testing out how we might be able to seal the gelatin material  <p>We realised that to ensure a tight seal in the material, we\u2019d have to heat it to just below its melting point, enough that it became viscous enough to blend into a solid piece of material but without becoming completely liquid once again. </p> <p>The optimum temperature we discovered for this is about 30 degrees Celsius.</p> <p>The Recipe: </p> <p>To make the material, use the recipe below: </p> <p>Water: 240 ml Glycerine: 48 g Gelatine:\u00a048\u00a0g</p> <p>This is the base recipe, (for larger batches like in our case, double each ingredient amount, and keep going till you get the amount you need) In our case, we needed 4 batches so:</p> <p>Water: 960 ml Glycerine: 192 g Gelatine:\u00a0192\u00a0g</p>  All the ingredients are added into one pot on a high heat and stirred until mixed well  <p>Next, we had to cast the material into a mould to give us a large rectangular sheet. This we achieved with a large acrylic sheet to which we added a wooden lip on each side to give us a cavity to pour the gelatine mixture into without it spilling. </p> <p>You will need some kind of acrylic, silicone or glass to build this mould, using wood as a base will cause the gelatine to stick and not come out. </p> <p>Important Learning!: Let the gelatine mixture cool just a little in the pot before pouring it in, otherwise, it will cause the acrylic to warp and you\u2019ll have gelatine pouring all over the floor \u2014 as we unfortunately discovered. </p> <p>Once successfully removed, the sheet of gelatine was allowed to dry to make sure that would have enough strength to withstand being inflated while still maintaining the elasticity we needed. </p>  The mould we used for casting and the process of peeling out sheets of gelatin material  <p>Laser cutting</p> <p>As the sheet dried, we designed some templates for the air pockets in Fusion 360, saved them as .DWG files (which you can find at the bottom of this page)  and laser cut them out of baking paper(if you don\u2019t have a laser cutter you can also use scissors, it will also work just fine). </p> <p>It\u2019s important to use something like baking paper, we learned from an instructable article that the grease properties of baking paper (when placed in between two sheets of the same material) will stop two sheets of material from sticking to each other when heat is applied across the material.  </p> <p>We used this exact process to make sure our gelatine sheet didn\u2019t just congeal once more into one big solid sheet. </p>  Modelling and laser cutting the air pocket templates  <p>Putting it all together</p> <p>When the gelatine sheet was fully dry, we cut our sheet down to size, placed our templates onto one half of the sheet, folded the other half back over, making sure to leave a little exposed area as an inlet for the air, and placed our material in the heat press available in the FabLab. </p> <p>If you can\u2019t access a heat press, a hair dryer will work just as well, start on a medium heat setting and apply heat evenly over the surface of the material. make sure to place the material on another sheet of baking paper that covers both the top and bottom of the material.

Then inflate each pocket by inserting a needle connected to a small length of tubing into the air pocket and inflating it. This creates a much smaller hole for the air to escape out of and can be sealed up quickly without losing any of the air inside the pocket. </p> <p>Once each pocket is successfully inflated, (you can either use a small pump like we did, or blow down the tube, both ways will work just as well as each other) you can wrap it around whatever object you\u2019d like that fits and know that it will be decently protected in case it\u2019s dropped during transit. </p>  Testing out how we might be able to seal the gelatin material"},{"location":"Term%202/03.%20Digital%20Prototyping%20for%20Design.html#how-we-felt","title":"How we felt:","text":"<p>At first we weren\u2019t all that confident that we\u2019d get the gelatine material to inflate at all as we hadn\u2019t managed to achieve a uniform consistency, with some parts of the sheet being much thicker than the other.

So let me try and break it down as best I can the way I understand them. </p> <p>Blockchain: </p> <p>A blockchain network can be imagined as a big spreadsheet, shared among many different computers. This spreadsheet or \u201cledger\u201d is used to store information, for example, financial transactions. Each time a new transaction takes place, it gets logged in the spreadsheet. Because this spreadsheet is stored on many different computers, it makes it very difficult to \u201ccheat\u201d or tamper with information, as each change would have to be logged on each different spreadsheet, making it virtually impossible to change information without anyone knowing, as the changed spreadsheet wouldn\u2019t match with the rest. This makes storing information on this spreadsheet very secure.</p> <p>Non Fungible Tokens (NFTs):</p> <p>They are unique cryptographic tokens that exist on a blockchain and cannot be replicated.

They are usually used to manage funds and are a different form of governance models, that rely on everyone having a say.</p> <p>Smart Contracts: </p> <p>Encoding clauses into source code in a manner which is automatically self-enforced and executed without the need for a central authority in the form of smart contracts.</p>"},{"location":"Term%202/04.%20Fair%20Futures.html#dafne","title":"Dafne+","text":"<p>We were introduced to to a platform being developed by faculty from SODA &amp; Fablab BCN called Daphne+, an online community that aims to break the typical system of creative content distribution by making a more fair and equitable decentralised system for creative content creators built on Web3 Technologies. </p> <p>The platform runs on a blockchain network and relies on the minting of NFTs for the creative content published to ensure genuine authorship and accreditation.</p> <p>The platform is designed to allow you to manage your Intellectual Property Rights directly yourself.</p> <p>It allows you to mint NFTs for the following:</p> <ul> <li>Images</li> <li>Video</li> <li>Text and documents</li> <li>3D models</li> <li>Software and repositories</li> <li>Audio and Music</li> </ul>  \ud83e\ude99 Access to the platform requires a wallet account (this is a type of digital wallet that allows for the storage and transfer of cryptocurrencies) such as MetaMask.   <p>How does it work?</p> <p>Creators using the platform are able to log creative work as being originally theirs by minting it as an NFT.  This creates a unique identifying token that is is always and forever spread amongst the blockchain, allowing them to always prove they were the first one to publish that work.  Minting that creative work also allows the creator(s) to be fairly compensated for their work through the use of smart contracts that ensure strict adherence to whichever distribution model you has the creator have chosen to publish under that anytime someone accesses a repository, a piece of software, an image etc. they have to abide by. Each time your creative work is purchased or downloaded, it gets logged on the blockchain network, ensuring a clear and transparent history of where your creative work has been used. The network also allows Patreon like features, where users can access exclusive unlockable content once an NFT associated with your project has been purchased.</p> <p>Importing content to host on DAFNE+ will create a link between the content and the blockchain network itself. Access to content can then be shared amongst members in a team.</p> <p>Content that has been uploaded to the DAFNE+ platform, can then be later minted as NFTs through the NFT marketplace.</p>  \ud83d\udca1 **Important to Note:** Publishing an NFT on the DAFNE+ network will incur a fee from the blockchain network it runs on. This cost is known as \u201cGas\u201d a common necessity to allow the network to be maintained and run. Typically associated with the Ethereum Network.   <p>I think the idea behind the Dafne+ platform is a really cool way of approaching the idea of intellectual property protection,  I think it\u2019s something that could make a real step in opening up and speeding up the pace of innovation. </p> <p>I think it could allow people to more freedom to discuss ongoing project work as opposed to the current model, where everything is hidden under NDA just in case ideas get stolen and protected first.  Whereas this distribution model, by logging and showing unequivocally that you were the first to develop this idea, it might potentially allow you to prove in court that you were indeed first if you feel that somebody has copied or stolen your ideas. </p> <p>If it ends up getting off the ground and popularised by creatives as a viable alternative to distribution, I think it could make a phenomenal addition to IP law and protection.

Then as you go about your day, you fill in the usage column with how long you\u2019ve been using that particular item, or how many grams of a particular food you\u2019ve eaten. The total energy consumption for each item is automatically updated to reflect these changes and logged on a pie chart on the home page to make it easy to understand.

Ranging from analogue photography, pinhole cameras, photosensitive paper, and film to using microscopy and macro lenses for phones to examine the world of the very small close up. </p> <p>This was a really interesting experience, and I\u2019m glad to I had the chance to explore some of these mediums.</p> <p>At the start of the trip, I showed up without any idea for what I wanted to research. So I\u2019d planned to just roll with every day and hoped that something would present itself. </p> <p>I came across what I was investigating by accident, really. </p> <p>The first day we were there, we had a series of workshops. The first was with a woman called Karina, who was working to reintroduce native fruit trees and species to the valley and surrounding region. It was this blend of traditional landscaping and forestry techniques to increase the health of these little saplings and get a starting fruiting garden going, which was really interesting to experience.</p> <p>In the afternoon, we had a second workshop from a woman called Anne Marie, whose field of specialism is herbalism and herbal medicine.  She taught us all about different kinds of plants, how to recognize which ones you can eat, which ones you can\u2019t, when you can eat them, what seasons and so on and so forth, which was really interesting. I think this was an activity we all really enjoyed as a group. </p> <p>The following day, we were taken out on a hike through the valley, led by a man called Fred, a naturalist and local who knew everything about the surrounding areas.</p> <p>It was on this walk that I sort of started to get an idea of maybe what I wanted to look into. I\u2019d come across a particular species of lichen that seemed to hang off of trees with these small wispy tendrils and would seem to collect water from the morning fog and dew before the sun rose up and suck that into its substructure. That seemed, to me at least, as something really interesting to explore. </p> <p>I\u2019d always been interested in biomimicry and it was something I wanted to explore a bit more in my design work and in my career so I thought this was the perfect chance.</p> <p>I hadn\u2019t really had much chance to do much of this kind of research while I was in university doing my bachelor\u2019s.

You shine a light through the object on the plate onto a piece of photosensitive paper. This turns the paper black, leaving highly detailed outline of your subject.

These could be placed on buildings or in parks along the sea, and as sea fog rolls in and moisture is carried on the air through these panels they would catch and trap that water and store it for later usage. </p> <p>I was imagining a world of symbiotic life, where we breed panels of lichen to catch water out of air in drought stricken areas. </p> <p>I 3D scanned the lichen with a very with a high resolution 3D scanner in an attempt to get myself a little 3D model of it that I could then use to further create different structures in a virtual environment to test out my ideas. </p> <p>I didn\u2019t get a chance to do that while I was on the research trip but I think that\u2019s something I\u2019d like to continue as a little weekend project maybe to just create some interesting concepts of what that could appear and what that could look like. </p> <p>So that was a really interesting little three-day long research project that I was doing while I was on the trip.

She critiqued the Anthropocene concept for overgeneralizing human impact, instead highlighting the importance of symbiotic relationships and the interconnectedness of life through concepts like \u201cHolobionts\u201d and \u201cSympoeisis.\u201d Using the MACBA Expansion Project as a real-world example, Torres illustrated the necessity of inclusive decision-making that considers both human and non-human stakeholders.</p> <p>Helen Torres is a Sociologist, Educator and Translator, who found a like mind in the work of Donna Haraway and American professor of Human Consciousness and Feminist Studies at the University of California. Helen began to translate Haraway\u2019s work into Spanish for release, and knows the most about Haraway\u2019s work short of Donna Haraway herself. </p> <p>Helen\u2019s class was focused on laying out and overviewing Haraway\u2019s work, focusing on the key theme of our individual and collective \u201cResponse - ability\u201d. ******During the talk, Helen framed the discussion through 3 main questions:</p> <ul> <li>How can we imagine a better future when the old paradigms of human exceptionalism, individualism and autonomy are not good enough to understand the challenges of living and dying on a damaged planet?</li> <li>How can we practice the arts of living in multispecies worlds?</li> <li>How do we take care of each other, humans and non humans, rendering each other capable?</li> </ul> <p>The act of \u201cResponse - ability\u201d is our ability to actively and ethically respond to the issues of our environment, underscoring the interconnectedness of life and the necessity for decisions that consider more than just human needs. </p> <p>These questions were aimed at challenging traditional paradigms, questioning how we can envision a better future that moves beyond human exceptionalism, individualism, and autonomy. These outdated concepts, she argued, are inadequate for understanding the complexities of living and dying on a damaged planet.</p> <p>Helen critiqued the term Anthropocene, (the time period on the planetary timeline considered to be when humans collectively have had an undeniable impact on the environment we inhabit) arguing against the seemingly common idea that humanity as a collective whole is the main problem affecting our planet as an unfair generalisation of human impact on the Earth. She highlighted how Haraway points out that not all peoples of the earth have lived the same lives and participated in the same problems of the world, therefore failing as a universal concept of responsibility. As the actions of a relatively small number of people in history (when compared with the rest) and the issues that they have caused should not be placed squarely at the feet of every human individual. </p> <p>Instead, she emphasized the importance of understanding the pervasive presence of symbiotic relationships that define our existence. Helen discussed the terms \u201cHolobionts\u201d and \u201cSympoeisis.\u201d Holobionts are described as symbiotic assemblages that represent dynamic knots of relationships within ecosystems. Sympoeisis, or \u201cmaking-with,\u201d challenges the notion of self-organization by emphasizing that beings and systems are co-created interdependently within complex networks. </p> <p>This further emphasised the concept of multispecies coexistence. Helen explored how we might practice the arts of living in a world that is not solely human but is shared with multiple species. This involves nurturing relationships that extend beyond humans to include non-human beings, emphasizing a shared existence and mutual care.</p> <p>Lastly, Helen emphasized the importance of \u201cstaying with the trouble,\u201d which involves engaging in creative and unexpected collaborations, termed \u201cmaking oddkin.\u201d This approach advocates forming relationships and alliances that might not typically occur, focusing on cooperative survival and flourishing in the face of environmental and societal challenges. Through these themes, Torres articulated a vision for living responsibly and ethically in a world that is intricately connected and facing numerous challenges.</p> <p>Helen situated these topics into a real world example, using the proposed MACBA Expansion Project to highlight how multiple actors and stakeholders, from politicians, neighbours, the museum itself, the skaters who use the area to express their culture, to the animals like dogs ,cats and birds that call the area their home need to have their needs considered and accounted for. </p> <p>She encouraged us to explore this topic through playful interaction, where we held a discussion as personifications of the different stakeholder groups to try and reach a consensus that would make everyone happy, to emphasise the importance of community inclusion in decision making. Helen used this activity to push us to begin to develop and nurture a deeper awareness of the interconnection we all share, and to take this into account as we begin to work towards actively respond to the problems and challenges we attempt to solve.</p> <p>I really enjoyed Helen\u2019s class, I admit to not really having heard of Donna Haraway before, and to have the ideas so succinctly explained and explored in this playful manner was something I really enjoyed, even if there were some ideas (like Holobionts) that I found somewhat challenging to understand. What I found myself agreeing with the most (and is something that I have always found myself exasperated with) is both Helens\u2019 and Haraway\u2019s rejection of the notion of Anthropocene as a collective problem, undoubtedly human impact has had an impact on the Earth, but to lay this at the feet of every single human on Earth is foolish, short sighted and alarmingly defeatist (I believe). While we are not solely responsible for everything, I think we are one of the few species (as of right now) capable of understanding and contextualising our symbiotic relationship that we share with the rest of the organisms on this Earth, and are therefore perfectly suited to shape our actions to better regenerate this relationship. </p> <p>Small localised actions can lead to big systemic changes. </p> <p>This idea is what has become central to me for my project research, and while I\u2019m still unsure of the final outcome and what it will be, I know that this idea is going to be a core message of it.</p>"},{"location":"Term%203/02.%20Future%20Talks%20Term%203.html#aqui-scaling-your-projects-beyond-mdef","title":"Aqui - Scaling your projects beyond MDEF","text":"<p>Too Long Didn\u2019t Read</p> <p>The Aqui Collective shared insights on scaling projects post-MDEF, detailing their evolution from a nonprofit to a worker\u2019s cooperative and their work on various community-focused projects in Barcelona.

They evolved into a worker\u2019s cooperative and undertook various projects like \u201cTeixent Superilles,\u201d a guide to Barcelona\u2019s superblock concept, and \u201cParking,\u201d revamping underutilized parking lots into vibrant public spaces.</p> <p>They emphasized the importance of sustainability and continuity in project management, advocating for strategic investment of time, energy, and resources, and addressing conflicts promptly to prevent breakdowns. They highlighted the necessity of scaling for impact, both locally and globally, and stressed the importance of impact assessments for internal evaluation and funding applications. Looking long-term, they advised giving projects a decade to fully mature.</p> <p>In terms of capacity building, building a committed community of practice and learning to delegate were underscored as crucial for creating multidimensional teams capable of tackling problems from various angles. Clement also discussed the importance of designing oneself out of the equation to allow projects to grow independently, documenting work for transparency, and strategically applying for funding to ensure efficiency.</p> <p>We followed this talk up with an exercise that helped situate the projects we were working on in the context of scalability and how these projects can develop further into something else.</p> <p>I really enjoyed doing this exercise because it helped me begin to dial in on how I want this project to develop afterwards. Right now I see this project existing as a tool, either as an online tool or a WhatsApp-based bot (or both, why not?) that people can interact with to learn. So it\u2019s an educational platform maybe, but the question still remains as to how does that stay funded unless we figure out how to run a localized AI model that can do all the total energy calculations and feed it back in a conversational tone, which currently we\u2019re using the models from OpenAI to do. It\u2019s going to have an inherent cost, and that inherent cost is something that we are not going to be able to sustain paying for in the indefinite future.</p> <p>So either it would have to be a tool that people would have to pay for to use, which seems counterintuitive, or we have to figure out how to run the models locally, or we open source it in a different way to encourage people to use it in a way that we hadn\u2019t quite thought of or be able to run locally on their own machines. </p> <p>But I thought the talk itself was really helpful because we learned how to situate these things in scalability and think about them. So there\u2019s still a lot to think about, but a useful first step.</p>"},{"location":"Term%203/02.%20Future%20Talks%20Term%203.html#closing-thought","title":"Closing Thought:","text":"<p>If we want something to change, we have to take the first steps to make those changes happen, as it otherwise wont happen by itself.</p>"},{"location":"Term%203/02.%20Future%20Talks%20Term%203.html#understanding-your-emerging-profiles-and-life-after-mdef","title":"Understanding your emerging profiles and life after MDEF","text":"<p>Speaker: Krzysztof Wronski</p> <p>Too Long Didn\u2019t Read</p> <p>Krzysztof Wronski shared his post-MDEF journey, focusing on how he applied transition design thinking through his practice, Tree Centred Design.

He highlighted how technology mediates human relationships and societal structures, arguing against the idea of technology neutrality.

The class emphasized the importance of design in embedding values into technology, using it as a lens to question whom technology serves and the political and power arrangements it reinforces.</p> <p>This was something I found particularly important, what particularly stuck with me was something Ariel said about the the way we understand what exactly is technology, and how this shapes our perceptions.</p> <p>When we see resources as technology (i.e. seeing a river as a source for electricity) it\u2019s the same way that we can end up seeing human beings as a source of human capital. </p> <p>The same for the debate on technological neutrality and the implicit values, the class gave me a framework to position the role design plays in shaping the technologies we use, because surely technology can\u2019t be neutral, as we see now even with the advent of AI and the biases that appear in the systems because of the training data that they use, as any technology is imbued with the values the creators had for it\u2019s intended purpose. </p> <p>It\u2019s something I think that is super important to consider and also try to put into practical action, as a product designer it\u2019s sometimes hard for me to acknowledge that for a lot of the history of this profession we\u2019ve been creating future archaeology (which is incredibly arrogant I know), and that we need to shift to considering the whole life cycle of what we design at the beginning stages of its conception to make sure that we imbue what we create with the proper values that we hold dear.</p> <p>We continued to explore the ethical role of design through various philosophical approaches, and Ariel introduced us to deontology, consequentialism, virtue ethics, and care ethics, each providing a different perspective on the moral implications of design choices. </p> <p>What I particularly enjoyed and resonated with were the alternative frameworks like \u201cSumak Kawsay\u201d or good living, which integrates indigenous worldviews and critiques of western capitalism, offering a more holistic approach to ethics that includes ecological and communal well-being.</p> <p>Overall, the class urged us to critically engage with the ethical dimensions of technology and design, encouraging us to consider how their work as designers can foster more just and inclusive societies.</p> <p>I found this class really interesting and especially helpful in understanding how to situate my project research \u2014 which uses big data technologies to create tools that visualise and communicate an individuals total daily energy (and embodied energy) consumption, in an attempt to highlight the sheer volume of energy we consume in a day \u2014 in the broader context of using technologies to shape system perceptions and the value we place to those systems. </p> <p>The values I want to convey with the research I\u2019m working on is one of sustainable and regenerative reduction, showing that technology is not something to be feared or used at the expense and exploitation of environment, but something that when designed properly and with the right intention and narrative be a force for positive good in the world.</p>"},{"location":"Term%203/04.%20Communicating%20Design%2003.html","title":"Defining purpose and getting the point across","text":"<p>This session focused on how to effectively communicate my Thesis project, understanding it and breaking it down into manageable information chunks for sharing in publications and online. </p> <p>We focused on messaging, what exactly the project message is and the best ways to share that message.</p>"},{"location":"Term%203/04.%20Communicating%20Design%2003.html#how-would-i-explain-the-project-in","title":"How would I explain the project in\u2026","text":"<p>The first exercise focused on helping us narrow and trim down the core context of our project so that we could explain it really quickly, like an elevator pitch. </p> <p>In a paragraph: </p> <ul> <li>Our project melds open-source hardware and AI to transform how individuals in first-world economies manage energy consumption.

Together with Nuria and Carmen we decided to combine our resources to create a large shelving unit that could be used to store the weird and wonderful collections of things and prototypes that our class had managed to accumulate throughout the year. </p> <p></p>  Our initial concept sketch, we imagined being able to assemble a shelving unity with absolutely no fastening screws to make it as easy as possible  <p>One of our main goals was always to keep it as simple to manufacture as we could. Our first design used a series of slots that would allow each piece to slide into the other securing it into place. At first this seemed like a solid strategy as it meant that it would need very little assembly time or extra fastening components like nuts and bolts. </p> <p>Using Fusion 360 and Rhino to model up our different ideas was a quick and easy way to visualise them both on screen and in augmented reality but exporting the files as .USDZ file types, something I highly recommend if you want to quickly understand the scale of whatever it is you are designing! \ud83d\ude03</p> <p></p>  The first iteration of our design, modelled in fusion 360  <p>However, we quickly realised that we\u2019d designed this thinking that we had more material than we actually did, sending us back to the drawing board to redesign the unit for the second time. </p> <p>We opted to go for an L-shaped design that would fit within our material constraints yet still work with the original fastening mechanism we\u2019d imagined, while also allowing us to maximise the storage space we could have. </p> <p></p>  The L shaped shelves, and the second iteration of our original design  <p>However, once we took this design in for review, we were told (and probably should have realised) that this structure on it\u2019s own without any other fasteners would be unstable, as there was too much space on either side of the vertical slats, which would create an imbalance and potentially topple over the unit. Not so great.</p> <p>So after some back and forth with one of our teachers (thank you Adai \ud83d\ude4f) we settled on a new fastening system and a third and more stable design. We opted for modular and stackable boxes, would would fit within our material constraints and would allow us to make an infinitely repeatable structure to create any kind of shape we wanted.</p> <p></p>  Sketching and modelling the new fastening features for our shelving design  <p>Using an online tool called Makercase, we were able to quickly streamline the process of making the required shapes, and then edit as needed to create the right fastening slots \u2014 in this case T-Slots. </p> <p>We included small patterned holes in which we could insert some dowels to support shelves inside each of our cubes, taking inspiration from the way Ikea do their shelving as well. </p> <p>We did however encounter some issues with the CNC machine itself, while we\u2019d designed our shelving to be milled by an M4 bit, we learned that had been broken just before we headed down to the machine, so that required a quick bit of design change and then we were good to go. The T-slot positioning was adjusted to create structural pressure from all sides and when that was done we were finally ready to mill out our shelves. </p> <p>This was a really fun project, I was excited to be able to experience using a large CNC milling machine like this as this was something completely new to me, and I really enjoyed the experience of designing something from scratch and bringing it to life through fabrication, I\u2019d been missing doing that for a bit so I\u2019m very glad we got the chance to do it again.

Our task for this module was to play with creating outputs using different types of sensors and the body.</p> <p>This module was very unrelated to what I had been researching and working for my thesis project so it was a nice break and challenge to focus on something completely different like this. </p> <p>For this module I partnered up with Marius and Nuria, where we played around with creating a soft sensor, which is essentially made of textiles, to detect changes in pressure. With the idea that we could use a sensor like this one to detect when someone is running or walking based on the pressure difference applied by their feet as they moved.</p> <p></p>  Citlali (on the left) explaining to us how soft sensors work and how to build them  <p>Citlali introduced us to a technique called OSC messaging, which allows internet connected devices to communicate with each other (as long as they are connected via the same router, for this any kind of internet router will do, it doesn\u2019t have to an active internet connection \u2014 it just needs to be switched on and broadcasting a connection port) and to a machine learning training tool called Wekinator. </p> <p>Wekinator is able to receive inputs from multiple messaging sources (including OSC messaging) and send those to the machine learning algorithms to process and generate outputs.  </p> <p>To test this out we used a program called Face OSC, which uses a camera to do facial recognition by mapping multiple points onto your face and then send that data over OSC to wherever you want. This is particularly useful as it is accurate enough for us to be able to train a model to detect multiple expressions. In our case we decided to try and train a model to be able to distinguish between happy and neutral. To do this we trained the model several times on happy expressions and then neutral ones. We gave happy expressions an output value of 1 and neutral expressions a value of 0. </p> <p>Once we finished training the model we were able to pretty accurately detect happy or neutral expressions through my laptop webcam. Though we did notice that it didn\u2019t do so well when it was looking at the faces of other people, as it was just trained on my face, it means that it could only accurately do it for me. This just further illustrates how large and diverse datasets need to be to be able to provide accurate and usable information.</p> <p></p>  Connecting face OSC to Wekinator <p>This was a lot of fun to experiment with and it was a really cool introduction to the world of machine learning. I can really see how we can apply this technologies across a lot of industries to help notice things that we otherwise might not be able to see. </p> <p>So using our newfound knowledge, we set about training a new model on the pressure inputs from the soft sensor we\u2019d quickly built out of some conductive textiles, crocodile clips and a barduino board. We added a nifty little feature that would change the colour of a neopixel LED mounted to the barduino board from green to red across a gradient as the pressure increased to help us visualise if the sensor was working or not. </p> <p>Once we\u2019d got our model trained we tested it out with the sensor and it worked! we were able to send data over OSC from the sensor connected to the barduino to the wekinator program and then even through to a programme called processing for further visualisation and complex output.</p> <p></p>  Our final soft sensor sending data via OSC to processing  <p>Because this was quite far away from my thesis project research I\u2019m not sure how I could apply this to that research, but it was still a lot of fun nonetheless and I\u2019m happy I\u2019ve been able to be introduced to this new field (even if only just scratching the surface). </p> <p>I\u2019ve learned how to programme OSC messaging between devices, train a basic machine learning model and build soft sensors, it\u2019s been a really fun week of learning and I\u2019m excited to see how I could apply it to different projects in the future. </p> <p>You can check out the code files and circuit files to try it out yourself below!</p> <p>To the fabrication files!</p>"},{"location":"Term%203/Digital%20Prototyping%20for%20Design%2003.html#module-5-extended-bodies","title":"Module 5 ~ Extended Bodies","text":"<p>In this module, we built on the knowledge and technologies we\u2019d be introduced to in module 4. Using Wekinator once again to train a machine learning model to to process multiple inputs, and send them via OSC to a new program called MAX-MSP to create audio visual outputs that can be interpreted by ourselves or others. </p> <p>Once again I partnered with Marius and Nuria, as well as Carlotta. We decided to keep exploring the idea of creating outputs from running. Except this time we changed our sensor device to something we all already carry with us when we go running, our phones.</p> <p>In the previous module Citlali and also introduced us to an app you can download on your phone called \u201cZIG Sim\u201d. This app allows you to access all the different sensors your phone has individually or together, from the accelerometer to the gyroscope, microphone and camera etc\u2026 and send that information over OSC messaging (among other ways) to another device to process that data. </p> <p>This was incredibly cool and it completely opened up new possibilities that we could explore now that we had access to these sensors as well.</p> <p>So to further develop our idea of creating outputs from running, we had an idea. </p> <p>\u201cWhat if we could change the songs you were listening to depending on if you were running or not?\u201d </p> <p>To explore this idea we decided to use the accelerometer and altimeter sensors of our phones to train a machine learning model in Wekinator to recognize the difference in cadence and speed between walking and running. Walking would be a, integer value of 0 and running would be a value of 1. We set the output values to be \u201cfloat\u201d values, meaning that as the sensor data is coming in it\u2019s being compared to either 1 and 0 and the output moves in a range between the two integers instead of a binary output. </p> <p>We connected the output values from Wekinator to Max-MSP, which would allow us to connect the values of 0 and 1 to two different audio outputs. In this case the audio outputs were two different songs, which would fade into one another depending on the cadence of your movement. Either playing the high bpm song for running or the low bpm song for walking. </p> <p>It ended up working really well! we had a great time trying to determine the different thresholds between the songs, and we discovered that for every single person it would be different as everyone has a different way of walking and running. This time we tried to train it on the data received from multiple people running and walking so that we could have a larger sample size but even then, the results were a little spotty from time to time.  </p> <p>Nevertheless, we learned a great deal, how to use this new and incredibly powerful program (Max-MSP) and further develop slightly more complex machine learning models. I could totally see how these technologies could be combined to make for a really fun exercise experience for example. Imagine having music playlists connected to your heartbeat, as you performed different exercises you\u2019d have different music that reflected each of those exercises, it could be a really fun way to explore a more audio sensory side to exercise or even meditation! </p> <p>You can find all the code we wrote for this project by clicking on the button below! \ud83d\udc47</p> <p>To the fabrication files!</p> <p>While this was again not directly connected or related to the thesis research I\u2019m doing with Carlotta,   there still bits that could relate later on, OSC messaging for instance seems to be a really reliable way to ensure connection between different AIoT devices, which could work really well with the energy tracking hardware we\u2019ve developed for our thesis research, that could work really well for communicating data in a way that no other actor could access besides the specified users.</p>"},{"location":"Term%203/Microchallenge%2003%20-%20Interaction.html","title":"Microchallenge 03","text":""},{"location":"Term%203/Microchallenge%2003%20-%20Interaction.html#designing-for-interaction-and-reflection","title":"Designing for Interaction and Reflection","text":"<p>This was the final microchallenge of the MDEF course, this time around Carlotta and I developed an interactive display prototype to illustrate the issues of energy consumption that our project research is trying to address.

The entire idea behind our research is not to make individuals feel as though it is their fault that we are consuming so much, rather it is to galvanise them to reflect and want to take action, no matter how small. Watching members of our class interact with the dial and rad the information displayed, it was great to see that this was actually giving them pause and take a moment to understand exactly what the numbers of consumption meant. To that end it was really good to have the various appliances plugged in to create a form of overwhelming sensory experience to try and illustrate that. We received some really good feedback from that first showing and we are looking forward to implementing that into the final display.</p> <p>The order in which the appliances are turned on is going to be very important, we are going to have to restructure it in such a way that the most essential appliances turn on first and scale to up to more and more convenience or luxury items that aren\u2019t strictly necessary to survival but to a quality of life that we\u2019ve become accustomed to. That\u2019s going to be really important because if we can illustrate that the items that we deem \u201cessential\u201d aren\u2019t necessarily so but we feel like we couldn\u2019t live without them, then perhaps that would be enough to motivate people to stop and reflect on just how much energy they use and is embodied in them, and if there was a better way to keep using those conveniences but with a lower energy consumption bill.</p> <p>That would be great, and is going to be the next step that we are going to focus on for the exhibit design of The WattWise Project.</p>"},{"location":"about/me.html","title":"About &amp; Philosophy","text":"I'm originally from Amsterdam, but share the UK as my other home nation, I grew up in countries all over the world and this has really shaped who I am as a person as well as my design philosophy, I've seen first hand how well designed products and services that are aimed at improving the lives of people -- everyone, not just the 10% that can afford them but the other 90% of the world who need them -- can create a lasting impact that brings about quality of life improvements that we can't even imagine.

It was interesting to see the gamified version of the methodology, which involved using a system of cards to explore emergent Weak Signals. With the guidance of Jana and Roger, we delved into these signals and identified areas of opportunity within them that could lead to different solutions.</p> <p>Later, we broke into smaller groups to focus on specific Weak Signal areas and brainstorm various pathways and solutions. This exercise was guided by random triggers, which helped narrow down our focus and stimulate our thinking.

It opened up so many new pathways for out-of-the-box thinking when it comes to developing ideas. While some of the ideas generated may not be great, the point is that it encourages dialogue and collaboration among all participants. On the other hand, if done alone, it promotes introspection and reflection.

It encourages us to question the things that have been normalized around us and completely rejuvenates how we think of ideas.

What surprised us (which in hindsight probably shouldn\u2019t have as it\u2019s quite old) was just how simple the insides of the microwave actually was. with most of the connectors being removable clips it showed us that this analogue machine (by which I mean it didn\u2019t have a digital computer acting as a brain behind it) was designed to have multiple components easily replaced as nothing was soldered directly to the board (except components making up the power supply). While it wasn\u2019t exactly easy to access some of the components (like the switches) it was nice to see that this product was indeed designed to be replaced if needed.

We were trying to give an analogue machine a digital brain. After some trial and error it worked! we are able to sideload some instructions onto our system that would allow the circuit to turn on and off on a 10 second timer. Connected via a relay, we are able to control exactly when and how the motors would turn on, the next task (which I assume is coming later in the week) is to figure out a way to separate both motors from each other, as right now, the induction motor we salvaged which was originally used to spin the cooling fan splits the high level of voltage coming from the AC power supply into a two separate streams, with the fan motor pulling the majority of the voltage and leaving 30V over to power the motor that originally span the plate inside the microwave. However, while this is really useful inside a microwave, it means that currently the plate motor can only spin when the fan motor is on. So in our quest to create an almost useful machine \u2014 in our case we\u2019ve been thinking of turning the microwave into a spinning disco light \u2014 we have to deal with a motor that will only work if the other is powered on and running, which might or might not turn out to be useful.

We really leaned into the idea at first and as we began exploring into what we could make we decided to see what else we could come up with. A bunch of ideas were tossed around, from a party in a box that would spray glitter everywhere once you opened the microwave door to a multicoloured dome that would rotate around the light in the microwave for different moods. Eventually we settled on the idea of creating an \u201canti microwave\u201d that would actively cool your food from above via the cooling fan as you attempted to eat it from the spinning plate below. The whole thing would be supported on a frame that you would have to reach around and make it difficult to eat. </p> <p>The idea behind it was to create a feeling frustration while eating, frustration at the difficulty of getting at the food and frustration at the fact that your food was actively being cooled while you ate. In a round about way we are trying to create something that allows you to empathise with people who may struggle to eat in a normal way, so it takes them much longer to do so, meaning the food gets cold and unpleasant to eat.  </p> <p>We mocked up a quick idea of how it could work, tested out how we would attach some of our components to the whole system and then presented it to the class for feedback and evaluation from the group.

After discovering that we couldn\u2019t give our AC components any more of a brain with Arduino than just turning it on or off for a period of time, we decided to run two separate circuits. The normal AC one that powered the cooling fan and the plate motor, and a separate DC circuit that would allow us to control a lighting and sound system, designed to illuminate the food with a cool blue light and play a really annoying high pitched sound that would only start when the food was placed down on the rotating plate. </p> <p>Because you obviously have to have a sound that plays to alert you that your food is being cooled down no? </p> <p>We scavenged some more parts from our original microwave chassis, specifically the bottom panel of the casing that supported a rotating ring that allowed the plate to spin, so that we didn\u2019t have to make a new one, as well as switch to activate the whole system when weight was added to the plate.

You can read more about that here. </p> <p>This seemed like a really interesting idea, so I wanted to explore how I could live those changes in my own life and note down what problems (if any) that I encountered. </p> <p>How and Why</p> <p>I decided to split my 24 hours into two halves, the first 12 hours I would change nothing, and simply note down everything that I used that consumed electricity, how long I used it for and using a simple formula, calculate how much power I\u2019d consumed using each machine. After adding it all up together, see if I was over the usage limit and then adjust my habits for the next 12 hours to see if I could stay under the limit and see how it affected me. </p> <p>The formula: Energy Consumption (Wh)=(\u2211Power Rating of Device (W)\u00d7Duration of Use (h)) </p> <p>It turned out that on that particular day when I summed everything up (probably not everything I used but a close guestimate) I was over the limit by 1440 watts as my fridge ate up all the power allocation for the day immediately at 2000 watts of power just on its own over the course of a day of using it, but without it I was actually actually under the 2000 watt usage limit, coming in at a solid 1440 watts! So, knowing full well that for this experiment I couldn\u2019t just \u201cuse the fridge less, or unplug it\u201d I wanted to make it even more of a challenge and see if I could stay under a 1000 watts of energy usage for the day. </p> <p>This meant doing a quick bit of maths to try and see where I could get some energy reduction without it impacting my life in a way that would normally make me want to stop doing it or affect me being able to go about my day of classes. With a bit of tweaking to laptop charger usage times, coffee machine, television and public transport usage I was able to contain my consumption to under 1000 watts. </p> <p></p> planning and outcome of the challenge <p> </p> <p>Lifestyle Changes</p> <p>I had to reduce the amount of public transport I took, which just encouraged more walking, and honestly, it really didn\u2019t affect my life much at all, it was quite fun trying to get into the nitty gritty of working around these limits. </p> <p>Involving yourself</p> <p>Now that being said, if I was going to continue doing this living under 2000 watts challenge, I would definitely need to get far pickier with all my appliances, starting with the fridge, and I can already see that from the amount of work I had to put in just at the beginning to document everything (which was a bit of a pain) most people probably wouldn\u2019t do it (heck I probably wouldn\u2019t either). But that\u2019s great though, as it now creates some really interesting paths to explore, to ask questions like: </p> <p>What if all our devices had a little display on them that showed you their power usage constantly so you could keep track? </p> <p>Could you use internet of things to create an ecosystem where products talk to each other and cycle their power systems autonomously so that other devices in the network can draw the energy that they need? </p> <p>and many many more. </p> <p>These are questions that I wouldn\u2019t have discovered really if I had just been looking the concept from the outside, sure I might have ended up going down the same line of inquiry at some point after much theoretical explanation, but really living it, even for such a short time, was enough to immediately highlight some of the challenges and areas of opportunity that can develop into new and exciting \u201cHow might we\u201d questions and routes of investigation. </p> <p>final Thoughts</p> <p>First person perspective is definitely a useful tool in the designers toolkit, and when applied correctly can lead to some really valuable insights at the beginning of a design project. It\u2019s something that I will for sure use in future projects and creative work, and documenting the entire experience through video or journals and audio logs, is an incredibly useful way of keeping track of what you are experiencing and can help lead to new insights later on when combined with other forms of research and user testing that come with designing any sort of solution. </p> <p>New possibilities for collaboration</p> <p>Finally, being able to see the work of my classmates, their explorations into different subject matters was an incredible experience and opportunity to get to know them on a much more creative level, with areas of research from maximising learning in VR to adapting to a world of surveillance capitalism, they all presented really cool opportunities for collaboration and I\u2019m excited to work together with them in areas that I have no knowledge in whatsoever, and see what kind of cool shit we can come up.</p>"},{"location":"term1/06-Design%20Studio%2002%20-%20Our%20first%20Intervention.html","title":"Design Studio 01.01 - Our first intervention","text":""},{"location":"term1/06-Design%20Studio%2002%20-%20Our%20first%20Intervention.html#intro","title":"Intro","text":"<p>Our second design studio class was led by Jana and Roger.

I was interested (and still am to this day) in exploring how we can change the value proposition around traditional waste material. How can we design products and services that are easy to repair so they aren\u2019t seen as waste, or how can we reuse waste from food industries to create new biomaterials for products?</p> <p>I joined forces with some of my classmates, Carmen, Carlotta and Minhea. We all shared an interest in reframing waste as a valuable material supply, from recycling concrete to creating biomaterials and changing policy.</p> <p>We then sat down to create a shared digital design space for our particular group interests to see if we could all find something to work together on.</p> <p>This was a valuable way for us to get all our ideas out on paper. It encouraged us to have conversations around what we actually considered to be waste ourselves, what our different ideas were around how we should go about preventing waste or recovering value from it, and how we wanted to explore it ourselves.</p> <p>Initially, we struggled to come up with an idea as to what kind of intervention we could make in the time that we had, as waste is such a colossal topic! But Roger reminded us that an intervention doesn\u2019t have to be the \u201cbe all end all\u201d solution; it doesn\u2019t even have to be a solution; it can be a stepping stone in part of your design research that helps lead to deeper and more interesting questions that provide the insight you need to get the real solution at the end of the tunnel. After that, we settled on trying to aim for a more reflective approach, where we would create some form of activity that we could do with members of the public to get their perceptions around waste and how we could try and change their view on it.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"term1/06-Design%20Studio%2002%20-%20Our%20first%20Intervention.html#our-first-design-intervention","title":"Our first design intervention","text":"<p>This intervention ended up completely different from what we had initially thought we wanted to do. We always had the aim of making a reflective activity that people could take part in that would challenge their ideas around what waste would be, but the path we travelled to get there was completely different to what I thought we would do.</p> <p>Our first plan was to host a workshop where participants could make their own biomaterial from household organic waste products and turn it into something useful. And to do that, we had to test out if it was even possible to create any sort of useful material in your kitchen.</p> <p></p> <p>So we got together one crisp Saturday morning to do just that, meeting in the biolab in the IAAC building to cook up a variety of materials based on recipes we found from Materiom (one of my favourite resources; learn more about them here) along with a few other sources.</p> <p>During this exploration, while we were cooking and discussing, we realised that this topic was far too broad and not something that could easily be condensed into a 1-hour workshop and that this process was going to far too long and not create the kind of impact we were looking for.</p> <p>So we pivoted.</p> <p>We returned to the drawing board and tried to come up with something new. After some time, we came across the work done by a group here in Barcelona called Domestic Data Streamers. They hosted all sorts of exhibitions with data gathered from people in entertaining and interactive ways that created the kind of reflection we wanted. So we tried our hand at this; we decided to make some interactive questions and host informal Q&amp;A sessions with the people living here in Barcelona.</p> <p>Starting with a primary survey we sent out, we wanted to get a rough feel for what people thought about some basic questions around waste and value. Asking things like what would you consider waste? And how have you repurposed your waste, if at all? And many more; you can take a look at the original survey here.</p> <p>Asking these questions helped us to look for the deeper questions in the answers we received. From these answers, we landed on 3 key questions we wanted to know the answer to:</p> <ul> <li>what they considered to be waste</li> <li>what they wanted to change themselves</li> <li>What was holding them back from making a change?</li> </ul> <p>These questions would be answered with a sticker represneting one of two statements, so we were actually getting an answer to two questions in one!</p> <p></p> <p>With these questions in mind, we created our interactive posters, stuck them to some large pieces of cardboard we found (very low-tech, I know) and proceeded with our intervention. We hung a set of posters up in our own university building to see what the reactions and responses would be from people who we thought would be the most likely to be aware of and working towards solutions around these issues and the next, we took around Barcelona with us!</p> <p>We wandered around the neighbourhood of Gracia, inviting strangers to participate in our research and see what they had to say. While this was initially a little nerve-racking, we got over it, and soon, we were chatting with people left and right and getting some fantastic insights. I\u2019m glad we took this approach; the answers we got and our conversations really painted an interesting picture that we wouldn\u2019t have gotten otherwise if we\u2019d done something else. Turns out most people are trying their hardest to repurpose the majority of their plastic waste into other useful things around their home and life, as well as turning as much food waste as they can into compost for their plants!</p> <p></p> <p>That was definitely different from what I was expecting.</p> <p>Overall, it was a fascinating data-gathering exercise. I\u2019m happy now that I think I have a better understanding of what a design intervention is and how it can be used to begin to create the alternative presents we want to achieve.

I decided to focus on using the unique properties of sunflowers(Helianthus annuus L.) that enable them to clean up pollutants such as heavy metals from the soil they grow in, a process known as phytoremediation and splicing in a series of genes taken from mangrove trees (Rhizophoraceae) that allows them to thrive in much harsher and saltier conditions that would be deadly to most other plant life found on land. Creating a new sunflower hybrid that could be planted in areas of land considered too polluted, degraded or marshy for other types of life. Cleaning up the surrounding soil by removing contaminants and leaving healthier, cleaner soils behind. </p> <p>Sunflowers are one of the most widely used plants for phytoremediation, as they can accumulate various metals and organic compounds from the soil, such as cadmium, lead, arsenic, and uranium. Sunflowers also have high biomass production, fast growth rate, and high seed yield, making them economically valuable and easy to cultivate. However, sunflowers are sensitive to salt stress, which limits their application in saltwater-contaminated soils.</p> <p></p> <p>Mangrove trees are a group of tropical and subtropical plants that grow in intertidal zones along the coastlines. Mangrove trees have evolved remarkable adaptations to cope with high salinity, low oxygen, and variable water levels in their natural habitats. For example, they have salt glands that excrete excess salt from their leaves, pneumatophores that facilitate gas exchange in waterlogged soils, and viviparous seeds that germinate while still attached to the parent plant. However, mangrove trees are not known to have phytoremediation potential, and their slow growth rate and low seed dispersal make them difficult to propagate and establish.</p> <p>By combining the genes from mangrove trees and sunflowers, I\u2019ve tried to create a hybrid plant that has the best of both worlds: the stress tolerance of mangroves and the phytoremediation potential of sunflowers. </p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>The project proposes to create a new plant that can improve the quality of polluted or contaminated soils and restore the natural balance of the environment using genetic engineering techniques to transfer genes from mangrove trees into a common sunflower variety. </p> <p>The candidate genes identified from mangrove trees and sunflowers are involved in stress tolerance, pollutant transport, and gas exchange. These are some of the genes we are going to use:</p> <ul> <li>For stress tolerance, we are going to use the genes encoding P-type ATPase transporters (HAKT1 and HAKT2) and ATP-binding cassette transporters (HABC1 and HABC2). These genes are involved in the vacuole sequestration of sodium ions and the maintenance of cellular homeostasis. These genes are found in mangrove species and confer high salt tolerance and drought resistance levels.</li> <li> <p>For pollutant transport, we are going to use the genes encoding metal tolerance proteins (MTP1 and MTP2) known as heavy metal associated transporters (HMATs). These genes are involved in metal detoxification and sequestration in plants. These genes are also found in sunflower species, and they have high substrate specificities or affinities for different metals, such as cadmium, zinc, copper, and lead.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Relevant HMATs</p> <ul> <li>HM-associated isoprenylated plant protein (HIPP) family,</li> <li>HM-associated protein (HMP) family, ferric chelate reductase (FRO) family,</li> <li>an expansion gene (EXPA) family,</li> <li>L-Cys desulfhydrase (LCD) family,</li> <li>metallothionein (MT) family,</li> <li>nicotianamine synthase (NAS) family,</li> <li>ubiquitin (Ub)-extension protein (UBQ) family</li> </ul> <p></p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>For gas exchange, we are going to use the genes encoding photosynthetic and respiratory enzymes, such as Rubisco (RBCS and RBCA), plastocyanin (PCY1 and PCY2), cytochrome c oxidase (COX1 and COX2), and laccase (LAC1 and LAC2). These genes are involved in carbon fixation, electron transport, oxygen consumption, and lignification. These genes are also found in mangrove species, and they enhance the gas exchange efficiency and the carbon sequestration capacity of the plant.</p> </li> </ul> <p>To make these changes, we will use CRISPR-Cas9, a gene editing innovation that uses site-directed nucleases to target and modify DNA with great accuracy. We can design different guide RNAs (gRNAs) that recognise and bind to specific DNA sequences in the sunflower genome and use a Cas9 protein that cuts the DNA at the target site and allows us to introduce mutations, deletions, or insertions of DNA fragments. To transfer these genes into the sunflower cells, we can use plasmid vectors and Agrobacterium tumefaciens to transfer the gRNAs and the Cas9 protein directly into the sunflower cells.</p> <p>To ensure the success of the new plant, we will comprehensively evaluate the performance and impact of the hybrid under diverse environmental conditions. We\u2019ll assess its growth and survival in various soil types, including sandy, clayey, loamy, and peaty soils, comparing it against non-modified sunflower plants. Additionally, we\u2019ll measure pollutant uptake, examining its ability to absorb metals, organic compounds, radioactive substances, and oil. Moreover, we\u2019ll test its resilience under different salinity levels, ranging from 0 to 500 mM NaCl, evaluating growth, survival, and pollutant uptake efficiency in these varying saline conditions. This multifaceted analysis aims to understand the hybrid\u2019s adaptability and effectiveness in remediating different types of soil pollution.</p> <p>I believe the proposal is creative and feasible. I hope this hybrid plant will grow in saltwater-contaminated soils and remove harmful substances from the environment while also providing other benefits such as biomass production, seed yield, and ecosystem restoration.</p> <p>However, it\u2019s important to acknowledge that the proposal has some limitations and challenges. We need to consider the ethical, social, and ecological implications of creating and releasing a genetically modified organism into the environment and the need to ensure the safety and stability of the hybrid plant and prevent any unwanted effects or interactions with other organisms. </p> <p>Overall, I think this has been a really interesting introduction into the world of designing with biology, a great way to reframe the way we look at how we can create in the world,  do all our solutions to the problems we find in the world have to be made by a machine in a factory? Perhaps not.

We delved into the implications of AI in our lives, pondering questions like when an AI could be considered \u201calive\u201d and the ethical dilemmas surrounding AI in weaponry.</p> <p>In class, we dissected the workings of AI systems and how they are built.

Ever since the launch of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT last year. I think that\u2019s why we\u2019re all so interested in it, because we\u2019ve all been using these AI tools much more visibly and in some cases (like mine) almost daily. </p> <p>We\u2019ve seen what they can do and we\u2019ve been exposed to how they can create these incredible, incredible things, helping us with so many tasks that before took us much much longer. </p> <p>The I think that this entire week has been really interesting because we not only had to learn about developing these AI systems, we learned about how they\u2019re built and what they\u2019re trained on. But in particular they put a lot of emphasis on the bias that can happen in these models based on the training data and how important it is to have incredibly varied training data to overcome this, but it\u2019s getting that varied training data that can be really difficult, and an AI model is only as good as the data its trained on. </p> <p>An AI model is only as good as the data it\u2019s trained on. </p> <p>One of the key things that I\u2019m taking away from this module is that this is another transition in our world and we\u2019ve opened the box.

Would you end up just relying on the AI for diagnosis or would you still go and check somewhere else? I think that there\u2019s a real risk that we just become overly reliant on these models, as they make it so easy to offload a lot of the grunt work of thinking.  </p> <p>At the moment all AI\u2019s (at least to my knowledge but I would love to learn I\u2019m wrong) still suffer from machine hallucinations \u2014this is where they just make stuff up \u2014 that could lead to some misdiagnoses and completely ruined crops if a more advanced system like Green Guardian was used on a large scale.</p> <p>The best part of this module was how easy it made to it to understand the basics and some of the nuances of AI research in the quest for machine intelligence.  It gave me a new appreciation for coding, especially coding Python. It always seemed like a scary foreign language, but now I understand it a bit more, I understand it\u2019s utility and it gives you this real window into how these systems work and the language that makes them tick. </p> <p>AI is a new, fantastic and amazing tool, it has the potential to do a phenomenal amount of good in the world, pushing us into exciting new futures that benefit everyone, but if we don\u2019t put the safeguards in now and understand that if we\u2019re going to create and use these models, we need to make sure that the training data we give it is as diverse and different as possible, that whatever data we train them on is fairly compensated to the original creators of that information and that we strive to develop these systems as ethically as possible. </p> <p>Finally there\u2019s one last question that\u2019s been playing on my mind since finishing this module, the large language models we\u2019ve gotten so used to using require an incredible amount of energy, not only to train them in the beginning but also to maintain the cooling necessary to keep the servers they operate on happy and healthy.</p> <p>So I\u2019m left wondering, what exactly is the environmental impact of these models that are so widespread now? How much does a ChatGPT prompt cost in CO2 emissions? This an interesting area to explore and something I\u2019m going to try and develop further as the masters program progresses.</p>"},{"location":"term1/13-Design%20Studio%2001.04%20Collective%20Design%20Intervention.html","title":"Exploring Non-Human Intelligence","text":"<p>For the past 2 weeks we took part in our second design intervention for our Design Studio 01 module led by Jana &amp; Roger. This time around we began a collective design intervention built out of our previous experiences, and interests. For this project my group and I had all expressed an interesting in using modern technology to better understand the world around us, and we wanted to explore the field of organic computing.

After this we fell into various pockets of discussion around what we had found interesting, what we had discovered over the course of our first group and individual interventions and what directions this made us want to go into now. </p> <p>I joined this masters wanting to explore all sorts of strange and wonderful new areas of exploration that I wouldn\u2019t normally be able to explore so I decided to try and explore an area that I\u2019ve always found interesting but is vastly different from what I\u2019m normally trained in, the field of interfacing technology with nature and moving towards organic computing. I ended up collaborating with my classmates Nicolo, Marius, Everardo, Jorge, and Albert, as we had all expressed an interest in this field.</p> <p>We had no set roles throughout this project so far, as none of us had any prior knowledge on plant signalling, except Albert I suppose, who is an ecologist. Some of us had more experience with Arduino and coding so they took on those roles, but overall we all worked to help each other out.</p> <p>When we started, we began with combing the internet for anything and everything we could find based on this topic (we found some cool stuff, I\u2019ll link it at the bottom of this article) from computing research using mushrooms to making music with the electrical signals within plants. With one of the most interesting projects we\u2019d come across demonstrating that you could use certain plants as analogue inputs and outputs. </p> <p>one of the most interesting projects we\u2019d come across demonstrating that you could use certain plants as analogue inputs and outputs. </p> <p>What this bizarre sentence means is that you can effectively connect two plants together, use one as an input, and the other as an output. Meaning you can send a message between two plants! (for more on this crazy subject check out the TED talk on this subject linked here)</p> <p>So it turns out that our little green friends are actually much more sensitive than we give them credit for and they are able to process much more information than we can see. </p> <p>After discussing what we had found out together and mapping out each of our interests in a collaborative Miro board, we decided on a direction. </p> <p></p>  Our early Miro board mapping  <p>We were going to try and receive, interpret and then eventually try and decode the electrical and chemical signals plants use to transmit information within themselves.</p> <p>Imagine what we could learn if we really understood our ecology? </p> <p>Luckily for us, some of these projects were open source and had freely shared everything they had learned on GitHub (bless the open source community). From these learnings we collected what we would need, a bunch of Arduino heart rate ECG monitors and the Arduino boards to control the whole system. </p> <p>Easy right? </p> <p>Not so much, first we tested the ECG sensors on ourselves and no dice. No matter how much we tried and what we changed, we just couldn\u2019t get the contact pads to read the electrical signals produced by our own hearts (which is how these sensors work) let alone read the the much lower frequency signals created by the plants we were studying. </p> <p></p>  A first test using the ECG monitors on ourselves  <p>We eventually managed to read some sort of electrical spikes within an Orchid that we were studying and our excitement was over the moon! Though that excitement was shot down pretty quickly when we weren\u2019t able to decipher if what we were reading was actual changes in electrical activity based on stimulus we were giving the plant or if it was just electrical noise and interference within the circuit itself. </p> <p>So back to square one. Shit.</p> <p>After a lot of work and research, we came across a project that had been using the same technology we were using to turn the electrical signals of plants into music using a MIDI synthesiser, lucky for us this project had been put up on GitHub (find out more here) and we were able to reverse engineer the code they used. Reverse engineering this code, along with getting the ECG sensors to work properly while also calibrating them was probably the most challenging part of the process at this point in the project. From this we were able to build a custom circuit configuration using our Arduinos and ECGs to finally be able to read the signals properly. </p> <p>Then came the moment of truth\u2026</p> <p>We connected our trusty plant friend up to the ECG pads and plugged the other end into the circuit, a few moments passed as the system booted and looked for something in the ether. We held our breath for a moment as nothing seemed to be happening, hovering on the verge of failure once again when suddenly\u2026spikes of activity! </p> <p>SUCCESS! </p> <p>To our shocked surprise it actually worked! We were reading the real and actual electrical signals within the plant! To test our theory we gently touched one of the leaves of our plant and shouted with joy as we watched the electrical signals spike as we touched it\u2019s leaves. To make extra sure we then fed it a little bit of water and as the water started to sink into the roots of the plant, another series of spike in activity! </p> <p>We\u2019d linked the signal monitoring program to a piece of software called Touch Designer,  which allows you to visualise pretty much any data input, so now we have some glowing spheres that grow larger or smaller based on peaks or troughs in the electrical activity \u2014 which I have to say looks pretty cool. </p> <p>We\u2019ve made progress and covered new ground, granted we can now read the signals but can\u2019t actually interpret them, much like listening to someone speak Latin when you don\u2019t, you know they are are saying something but you\u2019ve got no idea what. </p> <p>But still, progress. </p>  Our first Successful Tests!"},{"location":"term1/13-Design%20Studio%2001.04%20Collective%20Design%20Intervention.html#so-what","title":"So What?","text":"<p>At this point reading through this article (and it is a long article) you might be thinking, well this is cool and all that but what\u2019s the point?  </p> <p>Why bother trying to read and interpret these signals at all? </p> <p>Now that\u2019s a fair question, and one I asked myself many times throughout the project so far. </p> <p>Really the point is further try and understand the nature that surrounds us and be able to better interpret the needs of the ecologies that we live in so that we can begin to provide for them in different much more niche ways that we maybe haven\u2019t had the chance to do before. The better we can understand and take care of the ecosystems we are part of, the better they will take care of us. </p> <p>How often have you looked at a plant or a tree and thought right, well all it needs is a little soil, some water and sunlight and it\u2019ll be fine, I\u2019m definitely guilty of that. the reality of the situation is that these plants are far more sensitive to their surroundings than we give them credit for, and if we can tap into that sensitivity with modern technology in a non invasive way maybe we can get to the point where we could listen to an entire forest, being able to identify problem areas much much quicker, or be able to listen to and see how the first reacts to the presence of others in it\u2019s midst. That\u2019s what struck me really when I began this project, and the potential for others to carry this on after us to create concepts and ideas that redefine our relationship with the natural world is just so exciting! </p> <p>Granted, we actually need to move on and be able to interpret what the signals mean, but that\u2019s what designing with others and in an open source way is all about, that we can share this information with the world and others will build off our research to create something even better. That for me is the most important bit of work so far. </p> <p>I\u2019m happy I got to try and do some more technical understanding on this project so far, I think definitely moving forward I want to have a bit more focus on the technical application work, as that was left mostly up to Marius and Nicolo as they had the most Arduino coding experience.  </p> <p>I think it would be really interesting to develop a way for me to include some of my design skills further in this project, and I\u2019m happy it took the route it did, one of the key themes in my design interests is the theme of solar punk, which is all about using technology and nature in symbiosis to benefit everyone human and non human alike. </p> <p>And this project has helped me take one step closer to that future. </p> <p> </p>  The direction we want to take the project in in the future"},{"location":"term1/13-Design%20Studio%2001.04%20Collective%20Design%20Intervention.html#what-now","title":"What now?","text":"<p>Now we\u2019ve come to the next phase of the project, we\u2019ve discussed what we want to do for it as we head towards the end of the term and the Design Dialogues presentation, and we have a few ideas. </p> <p>We want to continue our research into non human intelligence, and we think we might be able to use different stimuli to measure different responses in the plant.
