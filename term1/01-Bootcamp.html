<h1 id="bootcamp-landing-week">Bootcamp - Landing Week<a class="headerlink" href="#bootcamp-landing-week" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>Published: October 3, 2023</p>
<div style="background-color: #f2f2f2; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px;">
TL;DR: My first week in the design program was a whirlwind of experiences. We met the faculty and fellow students with diverse backgrounds, shared personal items in an exercise promoting vulnerability, attended inspiring lectures on innovative design projects, and learned about documenting design and creating a portfolio website. Together, we built a mini fablab in our classroom, fostering collaboration and creativity. The program focuses on exploring complex concepts related to emerging futures, making it an exciting journey of learning and self-discovery.
</div>
<hr />
<p><strong>03/10/23 - First day and intro lecture:</strong> </p>
<p>On our first day of proper class (after the faff of registration), we were welcomed by Guillem and Tomas (two of the programme directors) and introduced to all the faculty members who will be supporting us throughout the course. They what we would be focusing on this semester and in the beginning the amount of work ahead of us seemed overwhelming and for a moment I thought <em>“shit, have I bitten off more than I can chew here?”</em> however, we were reminded that we are not designing alone and that we have the support of our peers, we are all in the same boat and our diverse backgrounds, ranging from politics, environmental conservation, business, and design is precisely what will see us through the programme, as everyone has a wealth of expertise and experience to offer that will always lend a new perspective or angle.  </p>
<p>We also met Laura, the third director of the program, who has a PhD in Philosophy. Although some of her concepts went over my head, I am excited to learn more. We took part in an exercise where we brought an item that held personal meaning to us and placed it in the context of epistemic knowledge theories. This exercise aimed to encourage vulnerability and sharing among the group. I shared my backpack, which symbolizes adventure, knowledge, and reminds me of my partner, who gave it to me. </p>
<p>Throughout the lecture, I found myself trying to plan my interventions and visualize the work to be done, but I realized that it was distracting me from being present in the moment. The faculty members are supportive and enthusiastic about helping us grow as creatives. The program seems to be constantly evolving and pushing the boundaries of design education.</p>

<p><strong>04/10/23 - Faculty Research areas and Poblenou Tour</strong></p>
<p>The day started with lectures from Guillem and Tomas, who shared their projects, research focus, and the impact they are making. The range of projects was inspiring, from sustainable hydrogen production to noise reduction smart citizen kits. The Fablab and Fabcity projects stood out for their innovative approach to rapid prototyping and design for the majority. After the lectures, we had a tour of Poblenou led by Chiara, one of our faculty members. We visited various projects and foundations in the area, including Biciclot, Bioma, Transfolabs, and Gallery.</p>

<p><strong>05/10/2023 - Documenting Design intro, building with Gitlab and Classroom rearranging with mini fablab</strong></p>
<!--
- Day started with a morning class in documenting design (or the importance of it, it’s benefits and how it will help throughout the course, our careers and our lives) taught by Pablo Zuolaga, former MDEF alumni from a few years ago. Pablo used to work as a creative lead for a marketing agency in Colombia, creating advertising campaigns for global brands around the world.
- taught us the importance of keeping a great log of everything we do throughout our various projects and creative work. Showing us examples from his own personal life where documenting this process and publishing is what opened new doors and opportunities that he had never even dreamed about or thought possible before!
- reminded us about how it can act as a great reminder and also a catalyst for creativity as you can look back on your old work, see and track your old thought processes, pick up where you left off from or notice was of thinking and doing that have now changed as you have gained new knowledge and ways of doing that maybe now mean that you are able to start up a project once again when before you had hit a roadblock and didn’t know how to get any further.
- he stressed the importance of using pictures and videos to aid in this documentation, and gave a really great breakdown of how to tell a great story through your project documentation that makes it both interesting and engaging to read and follow along with! (hence all the pictures and videos, they do say 1000 words after all)
- showed us how this type of documentation was going to be assessed by him and other faculty to see how we were keeping on top of our work and our project research, which is a great way of engaging with all the student work when they can.
- Every week we are encoruaged to keep a log of everything that has happened on that day and turn that into a relfection or blog post or what ever you like, as a way to document everything and keep track of your thoughts, feelings and processes about the work that we are doing.
    - funnily enough, alot of the things Pablo mentioned, i’d already learned studying my Bachelors in Product Design at Bounremouth University, particularly when it focused on the importance of documenting everything in reference to a portfolio of work, which I felt really happy about as I thought that I could definitely keep on top of this through what I already know.
    - What excited me even more though, was knowing that now I’m going to learn how to really tell a good story through all this documenting, something I was never really good at before, my previous portfolios and dsign documentation have always felt really linear, following the next logical step i.e Ideation, Development, Concept selection, Testing, Refining, Detail design then implemention. Never really including any sort of problem, troubles, triumphs and failures along the way, I’ve recently started to try and do this on my own to my exisitng portfolio website and to rewrite, reframe and structure it to turn it into a narrative. So having someone like Pablo (with all his knowledge in creative story telling for advertising) there to reexamine, review and bounce ideas off to further develop this side of documentation makes me really happy and I think I’m going to learn a lot from this.  Excited to see where this goes and how I can develop my writing further from this.
    - In an effort to improve, i’m going to try and keep my reflections brief but engaging, detgailing everything weve done and the research I am working on week by week in a blog post format that I want to start to share on other social media platforms and not just the website we are building so that it keeps me accoutnable but also hopefully engages a wider audience who might be interested in the work we do here on this masters!
- Following Pablo’s lesson we had a course from Josep Marti (our resident expert on all things coding and digital building) on how to create, set up and develop our own personal portfolio website using Github and Gitbash.
- this was super interesting and the idea of learning how to write it all and code it using python scripts through Git is a really cool thing that I want to get much better at over the coming weeks. Though I admit that I fell behind in this class quite quickly as I was still figuring out all the set up for it.
- this is an area I definitely still need to improve on, as coding is something I never really learned before and for ages never had any interest in doing so. Though now, it’s been put in a different perspective and I can see how it can actually be used to create products and services that I would use every day, and being able to do it myself gives me a real sense of ownership over the work which is great!
- There is still far more to learn that I don’t know but with the help from my amazing classmates and Josep I think we’ll get there!
- It’s a fantastic way of learning by doing ,instead of having to watch countless hours of video or lectures on the principles behind coding and then doing it later you do it right there in class and outside of it with a real goal in mind; to develop the website that is going to host pretty much all of the documentation of the work we are going to be doing this year (and coincidentally where all our work will be marked by the faculty — so it **has** to work) in one place. Making sure that we really learn it as fast as possible and create something that really works out in the real world instead of just small practice problems and solutions that never get used again after that. Brilliant stuff.
- After that, we spent some time rearranging the classroom into an orientation that made it more comfortable to work in and developed it into a space that we could really grow into and use to suit our needs for the year.
- We used the fablab on theg round floor of the IAAC building to create furniture and workbenches that we were going to need to prototype various things in our classroom —basically turning it into a mini fablab of it’s own!
- everyone worked together to achieve a common goal and it was a really great way to see how we were all going to work and interact with eachother which I really enjoyed! -->

<p>The day began with a class on documenting design taught by Pablo Zuolaga, a former MDEF alumni. Pablo emphasized the importance of keeping a comprehensive log of our projects and creative work. He shared examples of how documenting his process opened new opportunities for him. Pablo highlighted the use of pictures and videos to make documentation engaging and provided insights on storytelling through project documentation. We were encouraged to keep a log of our daily activities as a way to track our thoughts, feelings, and processes. </p>
<p>Later, Josep Marti taught us how to create a personal portfolio website using Github and Gitbash. Although I struggled with the setup, I found the idea of coding my own website exciting and empowering (though as of the time of this writing I have only just got my head round how to code this bloody site properly —thanks to ChatGPT). Afterwards, we  spent time rearranging the classroom to better suit our needs then headed down to Fablab on the ground floor and as a group (definitely looked like too many cooks in the kitchen, though if you looked close enough you’d actually see a well oiled machine of naive joy at work) we built a series of workbenches to create  a mini fablab in the classroom. It was a collaborative effort that allowed us to see how we would work together and forge a stronger bond amongst our small cohort 😃.</p>

<p><strong>06/10/23 - Exploring Elisava Design School Campus and Faculty member Laura’s Research background</strong></p>
<!--
- in the morning we toured around the Elisava campus (the other university we are part of and whose facilities we have access too — very cool stuff) received our welcome packs and intro lectures to how we can access and use the facilites and toured what they had on offer.
    - it’s a lot of high tech stuff but also a lot more rules than at the Fablab — there are more people they need to take care of so it makes sense.
- we had a lecture from Laura Benitez (the third director of our programme and a doctor in philosophy) on her research background and what areas she is focusing on now.
- A lot of really cool topics from Biohacking, to trans and post humanism, transfeminism and many more that went completely over my head. I think I’m going to really enjoy what she has to teach us but it’ll definitely take me some time to get to understand it all and really grasp the depth of her research and knowledge.
    - seems like her lectures will be focused on asking ourselves who and what we are, what is our fight/purpose/why, why we create the way we do and how does that develop who we are as we create for these emerging futures.
    - A lot of introspection here I think, in the next few months of the course. -->

<p>We visited the Elisava campus and received an introduction to the facilities. It was impressive to see the high-tech resources available to us. Laura Benitez, the third director of our program and a doctor in philosophy, gave a lecture on her research background. She covered topics such as biohacking, trans and post humanism, and transfeminism. While some concepts were difficult to grasp, I look forward to delving deeper into her research. It seems that her lectures will focus on introspection and exploring our fight, purpose, and creative development in relation to emerging futures.</p>
